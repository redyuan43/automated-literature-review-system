## I Introduction

The use of solar power generation systems (PVSs) is rapidly expanding duty to the fixed price purchase system of renewable energy [1]-[4]. Together with the increasingly widespread use of PVSs, accidents and instances of failure are increasing due to natural disasters and induced lightning. When a lightning strike occurs near the PVS, the bypass diode (BPD) in the solar cell module may fail [5]-[9]. Therefore, the BPD hit by the lightning strike either shows high resistance (open mode) failure or low resistance (short circuit) failure[10]. If the BPD fails in the short-circuit mode, a circulating current is generated in the bypass circuit (BPC), which may cause heat generation and burning of the BPD. Herein, we show that heat generation in the module is maximized when the resistance of the failed BPD ranges between \(10^{-1}\) and \(10^{1}\)\(\Omega\); therefore, the failure resulting in a resistance value within this range is defined as a typical heat generation failure [11]-[13]. Currently, Si Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) with low forward voltage characteristics and low reverse breakdown voltage are used as BPDs. Breakdown under reverse stress could occur more easily in BPD's as compared with PNDs. Dr. Haeberlin has been reported that damages at bypass diodes by induced voltages and currents in PV modules caused by nearby lightning currents[14]-[17]. However, little has been reported on characteristics of failed BPD by induced lightning serge.

In this report, an induced lightning surge is applied to BPDs (Si-SBDs or PNDs), and the electrical characteristics of the diodes are evaluated after the test; the failure modes of the diodes are then compared.

## II Experimental Methods

Figure 1 shows the outline of the induced lightning test. A combination waveform (IEC 61000-4-5 [18]) with an open circuit voltage of 1.2/50 \(\upmu\)s and a short circuit current of 8/20 \(\upmu\)s was applied to SBDs and PNDs as a representative induced lightning surge. Table 1 shows the specifications of SBDs and PNDs used in the test. In this test, the diodes are of the type used in a solar cell module of approximately 250 W comprising three BPCs containing cell strings and BPDs. In

Figure 8 shows the I-V characteristics of PNDs when the lightning surge is applied under forward bias. Destructive lightning tests were conducted at an open circuit voltage ranging between 2.5-10.0 kV. As shown in Figure 8, PND failure in the short-circuit mode begins with the charge of 19.5 mA's, and the I-V characteristics become more linear as the charge increases. Figure 9 shows the resistance of PND that is dependent on the charge of the lightning surge. Figure 9 shows that fault resistance decreases with an increase in the lightning charge. In addition, the failures of many PNDs generated heat in the lightning charge range of 19.5-34.0 mA's--which is the lowest lightning charge range that causes failure. Therefore, it is found that when lightning surge is applied to an SBD or PND under forward bias, the charge range that causes heat generation is wider than that observed under reverse bias.

### _Discussion_

SBDs and PNDs used as BPDs in a solar cell module are broken down by an induced lightning surge with a minimum specific charge. Thermal breakdown occurs via lightning surge current in the case of forward stress. In contrast, in the reverse bias breakdown, thermal breakdown occurs due to avalanche breakdown.

It was also found that heat generation occurs if SBD or PND breaks down owing to an induced lightning surge of a relatively small charge. As shown in Figures 3 and 7, in case of reverse stress failures due to induced lightning, SBDs showed heat generation in the lightning charge range of 0.291-2.397 mA's. In contrast, PNDs were observed to fail only at a charge of 1.60 mA's, indicating that the heat generation and burning potential is lower in PNDs as compared with SBDs. Figures 5 and 9 show that the induced lightning charge that gives rise to heat generation failure under forward stress ranges between 12.0-33.6 mA's in SBD and 19.5-34.0 mA's in PND. These results show that PND has a smaller range of heat generation as compared with SBD, even under forward stress. The risk of breakdown of PNDs is also low under reverse stress because PND has a higher Peak Reverse Voltage (\(V_{\Delta 0}\)) than SBD. Thus, it is preferable to use PNDs to decrease solar cell breakdowns due to lightning surges.

## IV Conclusions

In the present study, breakdown of SBDs and PNDs was evaluated via tests using lightning surges. The results showed that short circuit failures occur if a lightning surge at and over a certain charge is applied in either the forward or reverse direction. In addition, if the diode fails at a relatively low charge, the probability of failure that leads to heat generation and burning is greater. Furthermore, the results revealed that the range of lightning charges leading to heat generation is wider under forward stress than that under reverse stress, in
