## II Slow Light Using CPO in QWs [8, 9, 10, 11, 23]

In a two-level system, the optical absorption peak corresponds to a negative derivative \(\partial n/\partial\omega\) and leads to fast light, which is also called anomalous absorption dispersion. In the presence of an intense optical pump beam with the photon energy near the transition energy of the two-level system, absorption saturation occurs due to depletion of the population in the lower energy state. If a weak signal beam with a frequency slightly detuned from that of the pump beam is present, as shown in Fig. 1(a), the population of the excited state will beat at a frequency determined by the pump-signal detuning. Significant population beating occurs when the population can follow closely the intensity profile due to the time-dependent interference between the optical fields of the pump and signal beams. Thus, a reduction of the absorption, which shows a coherent spectral hole characterized by the inverse radiative lifetime, will be present, as shown in Fig. 1(b). From Kramers-Kronig (KK) relation due to causality condition, an absorption dip leads to a variation of the refractive index spectrum with a positive slope in the same frequency range, yielding the slow light effect.

To utilize the radiative lifetime, a pump-probe setup sensing CPO of the energy levels in the solid-state material system, such as ruby crystal, has been demonstrated [7] with a bandwidth varying from 10 Hz up to kilohertz. In semiconductors,

(b) Top—absorption spectrum of the probe in the absence (long dashed curve) and the presence (solid) of a strong pump. The spectral hole (dotted curve) is caused by CPO produced by the pump and probe beams. Bottom—the corresponding refractive index spectrum in the presence of CPO [23].

examples of such quasi-two-level systems are the exciton bound state in QWs or self-assembled QDs. The nanosecond radiative lifetime in semiconductors corresponds to a gigahertz bandwidth and is suitable for practical applications. We describe slow light using CPO effect from heavy-hole (HH) excitons in QWs [8, 9, 10, 11]. We have also developed a theoretical model based on the density-matrix formalism taking into account the spin-up and spin-down HH excitons, the dipole selection rule, and other nonlinear effects which couple the two spin subsystems [9]. Our theoretical results agree well with the experimental data [8].

### _Experimental Demonstrations_

In the following, we summarize our recent experimental slow light results obtained from CPO effects in QWs. In all experiments, a pump laser and a probe laser of frequencies \(\nu_{\mathrm{p}}\) and \(\nu_{\mathrm{s}}\), respectively, are used to create the coherent beating of carriers, which changes absorption and refractive index spectra seen by the probe laser. In the first experiment [8, 9], surface-normal geometry is used and low-temperature (10 K) measurements of absorption dip and refractive index change as a function of pump-probe detuning \((\delta=\nu_{\mathrm{s}}-\nu_{\mathrm{p}})\) are obtained for various pump wavelength and power. A slowdown factor is inferred from the dispersion curves. In the second experiment [10], surface-normal geometry is also used. Time-domain measurements were made by modulating the pump laser with a single-tone, sinusoidal signal, which creates two side bands onto the pump laser. The two side bands are used as the probe signals with detunings being the modulation frequency \(+\delta\) and \(-\delta\). The time delay imposed onto the probe beams manifests itself as a time delay of the sinusoidal modulated signal on the pump laser, which is directly measured relative to the original signal. In the third experiment [11], we used time-domain measurements at room temperature with a WG geometry.

#### Ii-A1 Measurements of Dispersion Curves

The sample used in experiments 1 and 2 consists of 15 GaAs \((135\ \mathrm{\AA})/\) Al\({}_{0.3}\)Ga\({}_{0.7}\)As \((150\ \mathrm{\AA})\) QWs grown by molecular beam epitaxy and is mounted on a sapphire disk with the substrate removed. The sample is kept at a temperature of 10 K. A continuous-wave (CW) Ti-sapphire laser and a tunable diode laser are used to provide the pump and probe beam, respectively. The two beams are focused onto the same spot of the sample. The probe is split into two beams before the sample, traveling through a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) with the sample in one arm. The absorption spectra are obtained with transmission measurements with and without the pump laser. A homodyne detection scheme is used at the output of the MZI to measure the dispersive characteristics. This setup allows us to measure both the real and imaginary parts of the complex refractive index simultaneously.

Fig. 2 shows the experimental data [8, 9] (from the first experiment) of the absorbance spectrum of the probe light, in the presence of a fixed pump light with its energy near the exciton absorption peak from the first experiment [8]. The polarization of the pump is polarized in the same direction as the probe light. The background absorption decreases, while the coherent spectral hole opens up with increasing pump intensity, showing clear evidence of excitonic CPO. Fig. 3(a) shows absorption and dispersion spectra as a function of detuning for pump and probe intensities of 1 and 0.09 kW/cm\({}^{2}\), respectively. The length, \(L\) is the total thickness of the 15 QWs (\(=15\times 13\ \mathrm{nm}=195\ \mathrm{nm}\)). The absorption \(\alpha L\) is defined by \(I_{\mathrm{out}}=I_{\mathrm{in}}\exp(-\alpha L)\). The spectra were obtained near the HH exciton resonance. The absorption spectra feature a sharp dip centered at zero detuning. The depth of the absorption dip increases with increasing pump intensity. The sharp absorption dip arises from CPO induced by the pump and probe. The absorption dip shows a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) bandwidth of 2 GHz (FWHM), which is inversely proportional to the lifetime of the population grating.

The group velocity \(\nu_{\mathrm{g}}\) can be obtained directly from the dispersion of the refractive index. The homodyne signal is proportional to the cosine of the phase delay \(\Delta\beta(\nu_{\mathrm{s}})L\) of the probe beam propagating through the sample. For small variations of the phase delay induced by the pump, the variation of the cosine function can then be approximated by \(\Delta\beta(\nu_{\mathrm{s}})L\). The phase

Fig. 3: (a) Phase delay (solid line) and absorption (dotted line) experienced by the probe. The slope of the phase delay gives the group velocity. The pump and probe intensities are 1 and 0.09 kW/cm\({}^{2}\), respectively. (b) The pump intensity dependence of the slowdown factor of the group velocity as obtained from dispersion (solid circles) and absorption measurements (open circles). The probe intensity is \(6\ \mathrm{W/cm^{2}}\).

delay of the probe beam is obtained after normalization of the homodyne signal with respect to the absorption spectrum. The slope of the dispersion at zero detuning reveals a slow-down factor of \(S=31\,200\) or, equivalently, a group velocity of 9 600 m/s.

Fig. 3(b) shows the pump intensity dependence of the slowdown factor. The slowdown factor initially increases with increasing pump intensity and peaks before decreasing above 4 kW/cm\({}^{2}\). This behavior is in agreement with the pump intensity dependence of the associated absorption dip, which first shows emergence of the absorption dip, then saturation and broadening as the pump intensity increases.

For a Lorentzian line shape, there is a simple relation between the slowdown factor \(S\) at \(\delta=0\), the FWHM bandwidth \(\Delta\nu\), and the depth \(\Delta\alpha\) of the absorption dip:

\[S=\frac{c}{2\pi}\frac{\Delta\alpha}{\Delta\nu}. \tag{3}\]

This result arises directly from KK relations and shows how the absorption dip relates to the group velocity reduction. Using (3), we can calculate the slowdown factor by extracting \(\Delta\alpha\) and \(\Delta\nu\) from the absorption spectra as shown for example in Fig. 3(a). The results are plotted in Fig. 3(b) as open circles. As shown in Fig. 3(b), the slowdown factor \(S\) obtained from the dispersion measurement agrees well with that obtained from absorption measurement with (3) though the numerical value from the absorption measurement tends to underestimate the result, possibly due to slight deviations of the absorption dip from an ideal Lorentzian lineshape.

#### Iii-B2 Time-Domain Measurements

In the second experiment, time-domain measurements were made through the same 15-QW sample. A RF-amplitude modulation (AM) with a variable frequency \(f\) is imposed onto a single-mode Ti:Sapphire laser. Sidebands generated by the AM act as the signal, whereas the central band with the carrier wavelength of the laser acts as the pump. The two side bands experience phase change with opposite signs, which thus manifests as a time delay. As pump and signal are effectively imposed onto the same beam; and, therefore, perfect mode matching is guaranteed. The modulation frequency \(f\) determines the detuning between pump and signal. The sample is cooled to \(T=10\) K and a modulation depth of \(\sim\)5% is used in the experiment.

At low intensity levels, the width of the CPO absorption dip is determined by the inverse of the HH-exciton lifetime \((T_{1})\). The half-width at half-maximum of 120 MHz reveals \(T_{1}=1.3\) ns, which is consistent with previous studies [9]. Note that effects of spatial diffusion are inherently absent in the measurement carried out here as pump and signal fields are co-propagating. This explains the linewidth reduction of the CPO resonance over previous frequency-domain measurements [8].

Fig. 4(a) shows the power dependence of the optical delay for various modulation frequencies. Delays increase at first with increasing power, peak, and rolloff as power is further increased. The power dependence reflects the saturation behavior and power broadening of the CPO absorption dip. More importantly, it demonstrates the convenience with which the delay can be tuned optically, as shown in Fig. 4(b). Time delays \(>1\) ns are achieved at \(f=25\) MHz. Given the length of the active region \(L\) (195 nm), this time delay corresponds to group velocities as low as 200 m/s and a slowdown factor \(S\sim 1.5\times 10^{6}\).

The greatly increased slowdown factor over that obtained from the first experiment arises mainly from the absence of exciton spatial diffusion [8], which led to a linewidth/bandwidth reduction and an increase of the transparency depth by a similar factor. The slowdown factor thus shows an overall increase roughly given by the square of the linewidth/bandwidth reduction factor.

In the third experiment, we presented room temperature time-domain measurements of slow-light propagation via CPO on the HH-exciton transition in a (110)-oriented GaAs single-QW WG. We used a WG geometry, which provides several advantages over the surface normal geometry. First, a large and variable optical depth can be easily achieved simply by controlling the length of the WG sample. Second, due to the strong optical confinement in the WG, high optical intensities required to achieve CPO at room temperature (RT) are more readily attained. Third, diffraction effects are suppressed as the optical field, while interacting with the QW region, is propagating as a confined WG mode. Finally, the use of a WG facilitates future device integration. Despite exciton ionization, results are similar to those obtained at low temperature and reflect the general properties associated with a CPO process. More specifically, the measured operating bandwidth is related to the recombination rate of electron-hole pairs. The induced transparency, and hence the maximum achievable fractional delay, scales with the optical depth of the linear response. We demonstrate maximum fractional delays of 3.2% for an initial optical depth of \(\Gamma\alpha L\approx 4\), (\(\Gamma=\) confinement factor, \(\alpha=\) absorption coefficient, \(L=\) sample length).

The QW WG sample was grown on a (110)-oriented n-type GaAs wafer, and the growth (starting from the substrate) includes 1.19 \(\mu\)m of Al\({}_{0.26}\)Ga\({}_{0.74}\)As, 0.17 \(\mu\)m of Al\({}_{0.15}\)Ga\({}_{0.85}\)As, 60 nm Al\({}_{0.3}\)Ga\({}_{0.7}\)As, 5.4 nm GaAs QW, 0.345 \(\mu\)m of Al\({}_{0.3}\)Ga\({}_{0.7}\)As, and 20-nm GaAs cap layer. The overall structure provides a single mode planar WG. The QW is located slightly off center from the fundamental mode. Numerical simulation using this structure shows that only the fundamental mode propagates. The confinement factor \(\Gamma\) is about 1%.

Fig. 4: (a) Power dependence of the time delay at various modulation frequencies. (b) Off-resonant modulation trace and resonant modulation traces at powers of 2 and 8 mW (\(\delta=100\) MHz) demonstrating controllable delay.

The sample was mechanically polished, and a 440-\(\mu\)m-long WG strip was cleaved. The strip was mounted on a thin copper bridge using silver paste to provide a good thermal contact.

Time-domain measurements were made in a similar manner as in experiment 2. TE-polarized light is coupled in and out of the WG. The transmission is characterized carefully as a function of the pump wavelength and detuning/modulation frequency. With \(L=440\)\(\mu\)m and \(\Gamma=1\%\), we obtain \(\alpha=9\times 10^{3}/\)cm\({}^{2}\), consistent with typical values of GaAs QW absorption coefficients at room temperature [39, 40]. Fig. 5(a) shows a generic example of two modulation traces recorded for on and off resonant with HH transition, with a modulation frequency \(f=100\) MHz and input power \(P=75\) mW. The resonant trace exhibits a delay \(\tau\) with respect to the off-resonant trace. To demonstrate that the observed slowdown is indeed the effect from CPO, we record a series of modulation traces for different modulation frequencies and input power levels. The results are summarized in Fig. 5(b), in which delay is plotted as a function of modulation frequency at three different power levels. The solid lines are Lorentzian fits centered at \(f=0\) MHz. Delays up to 830 ps and 3.2% fractional delay (\(\xi=\tau f\)) are measured for the highest available input power \(P=75\) mW and \(f=25\) MHz. The inset shows the power dependence of the linewidth (FWHM) \(\Delta\nu\), which is obtained from the Lorentzian fits.

For the measured maximum delay of \(\tau=830\) ps, we obtain a slowdown factor \(S=565\) (using \(S=c\tau/L\), \(L=440\)\(\mu\)m), which is three orders of magnitude smaller than that obtained in our low-temperature study [10]. The discrepancy is mainly due to the fact that we are using a WG rather than a surface normal geometry here. Whereas the entire optical mode interacts with the QW active region in surface normal geometry, it does so with a significantly reduced confinement factor \(\Gamma\) in the case of a WG. The discrepancy in slowdown factors thus mainly reflects the effect of reduced overlap of the optical mode with the active region. With an improved WG design, e.g., higher confinement factor, increased slowdown factors are expected.

### _Theory and Comparison With Experiment [9]_

Fig. 6 shows a simple two-level system based on the conduction to HH excitonic transition [9, 41]. This two-band model with two spin subsystems can be effectively transformed into two independent two-level subsystems only if the two lowest \(1s\) HH excitons of opposite spins are included.

We have calculated the transmission spectra [9] by taking into account the variation of the refractive index and absorption in the QW region. The theory shows that extracted absorbance in the experiment [8] can be directly treated as the single-pass absorbance in the QW region. In our theoretical calculations: the excitonic energy \(\hbar\omega_{\mathrm{ex}}\) is 1.5358 eV; the photon energy of the pump \(\hbar\omega_{\mathrm{p}}\) is the same as the excitonic energy. The sample used in the experiment consists of \(15\) GaAs/Al\({}_{0.3}\)Ga\({}_{0.7}\)As QWs. The barrier width between two QWs is 150 A. The width of each QW is about 135 A. The effective length of the absorption region \(L_{\mathrm{eff}}\) is thus \(15\times 135\) A \(=2025\) A.

Fig. 7(a) shows the calculated absorbance spectra for the parallel-polarization configuration under different pump intensities. This calculation is performed by matching the background saturated absorption, and magnitude of the spectral dip. Other variables in our model include variation of pump intensities, population relaxation constant \(\Gamma_{1}(=1/T_{1})\), the intrinsic dephasing constant \(\Gamma_{2}^{(0)}\), and a constant \(\gamma\) which describes the excitation induced dephasing. The absorbance spectrum is the product of the absorption spectrum and the effective length of the absorption region. The corresponding real parts of the refractive index are shown in Fig. 7(b). With increased pump intensity, the background absorbance is gradually saturated due to power broadening. When the signal detuning is roughly within the range of the population relaxation constant \(\Gamma_{1}\), an absorption dip is created. For direct-band-gap semiconductors, the bandwidths are about a few gigabertas. The spectral width of the dip also gets broadened as the pump intensity is increased. The ratio between the depth and background saturated absorbance increases as the pump intensity gets higher. However, theoretically, the real depth of the dip has a maximum at a particular pump intensity. From the KK relation, the real part of the refractive index corresponding to the absorption dip must have a rapid increase as the frequency of the signal detuning increases. In Fig. 7(b), the slope of the real part of the refractive index at zero detuning initially increases as the pump intensity gets higher, which reflects the increase of the depth of the spectral dip. However, two factors stop the increase of the slope at high pump intensity. The first one is the broadening of the spectral width of the dip as the pump intensity increases.

The trace obtained on-resonance with the HH-exciton transition (820.5 nm) is delayed from the reference trace (828.5 nm). (b) Delay as a function of modulation frequency for \(P=25,50,75\)-mW input power. Solid lines are Lorentzian fits. The inset shows the power dependence of the FWHM as obtained from the numerical fits.

Fig. 6: Level configuration of the excitonic CPO. The positive-helicity components of the pump and signal as well as the spin-down C and HH bands consist of one subsystem while their counterparts form the other.

This will broaden the range in which the fast variation of the real part of the refractive index takes place and thus reduces the slope. The second one is the saturated background absorption limiting the absolute depth of the dip. The variation of the real part of the refractive index is subjected to this saturation and result in the decrease of the slope.

Besides the rapid change of refractive index in a local frequency range, the global offset of the refractive index also varies as the pump intensity changes. Theoretically, if the change of dielectric constant caused by the optical transition is small compared with the background dielectric constant, the offset should remain constant as the pump increases. This constant will reflect the background dielectric constant only. On the other hand, if the change of the dielectric constant is significant enough, this offset will be modified by the change of dielectric constant itself. For excitonic CPO, because a large and rapid change is created in a narrow frequency range, there is no guarantee for the constancy of this offset.

A comparison between the theory curves in Fig. 7(a) can be made with the experimental curves in Fig. 2. For details, please refer to [8] and [9]. The pumping intensities for the fitting are set as 0.59, 2.96, 5.93, 21.2, 46.6, and 423 W/cm\({}^{2}\). They are chosen to match the background saturated absorbance. The intensities used in theoretical fitting are about one-third or one-fifth of the experimental values. The discrepancy may result from the fact that the actual pump intensity entering the absorption region is not as large as the estimated intensity outside the sample. Compared with experiment, the theoretical fitting tends to overestimate the depth of the dips. This may be due to the neglect of several factors in our models including the phase-space filling and the reduction of oscillation strength due to electron-hole plasma screening.

Fig. 8(a) shows the experimental result of the phase delay of the signal and the corresponding absorbance as a function of detuning for the parallel-polarization configuration of the pump and probe. The phase delay of the optical signal describes the variation of the real part of the refractive index when the pump is present. In the experiment [8], the measurement was carried out by a MZI. From this phase difference, the variation of the real part of the refractive index and the slowdown factor are experimentally obtained. Fig. 8(b) shows the theoretical result for the corresponding experiment. The shape and magnitude of the phase delay and absorbance agree well with those obtained from the experiment. Fig. 8(c) shows the calculated slowdown factor from our theoretical results. The peak slowdown factor is about \(3.13\times 10^{4}\), which agrees well with the value \(3.12\times 10^{4}\) obtained experimentally.

## III Slow and Fast Light Using CPO

in QD-SOAs [29, 30, 31, 32]

An idea for room temperature observation of CPO is to use QDs to improve the confinement of electrons and holes by the QD potential. This avoids the thermalization or ionization of electron-hole pairs (or the exciton bound state) of the QWs in Section II when temperature is raised. Observation of slow and fast light based on CPO effects in QD-SOA gain media or a reverse-biased QD electroabsorption modulator have been reported [29, 30, 31, 32]. A controllable slow or fast light medium by means of counter-propagating pump and probe induced CPO has been demonstrated.

### _Fast Light in a Forward-Biased Gain Regime [30]_

In a large forward-biased QD-SOA gain regime, fast light effects via CPO effects have been observed at room temperature using a counter-propagational pump and probe laser setup, which avoids the four-wave-mixing effects since the phase-matching conditions have to be met. The biased current is beyond the transparency current level when the modal gain is larger than the background modal loss. The changes of gain and group index are measured by use of modulation phase-shift method [42]. The pump is a commercial DFB laser with a lasing wavelength of 1290 nm. The probe, output from a tunable laser source, is fed into the network analyzer and modulated by a 130-MHz RF signal. The gain and group index experienced by the probe in the QD SOA can be determined from the transmission and phase delay of the RF signal measured by the network analyzer. The QD SOAs are fabricated from a sample with 10 stacks of InAs/GaAs QDs grown on a GaAs substrate. P-type doping is introduced in the middle of the 35-nm GaAs barriers between the QD stacks. The active region is

sandwiched between the two 1500-nm-thick Al\({}_{0.35}\)Ga\({}_{0.65}\)As layers which provide optical confinement in the vertical direction. The WG of the QD SOAs is designed to be tilted by an angle of 7\({}^{\circ}\) with respect to the crystal facet to avoid FP cavity resonances. The width of the single mode ridge-WG is about 4 \(\mu\)m. The length of the cavity is about 2 mm. Under a 300-mA current injection, the QD SOA shows an optical modal gain of about 28 cm\({}^{-1}\) with a saturation power \(P_{\rm sat}\) of about 30 mW.

Fig. 9(a) and (b) shows the RF signal phase and transmission spectra of the probe with the QD SOA biased at a fixed current of 300 mA. The optical pump power is varied using an optical attenuator with the attenuation set to 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 dB, respectively. A good agreement between our theoretical (black) and experimental (gray) curves is demonstrated. The dips in the gain spectra due to the CPO effect are presented as the spectral holes in transmission in Fig. 9(b). Since the strength of the dynamic grating is proportional to the pump power, the CPO dip becomes deeper for a higher pump. The background reduction of the gain spectra can be understood as a result of the carrier depletion by the optical pump. The RF phase delay of the probe is given in Fig. 9(a). The dips in the phase delay spectra correspond to the decrease in group index in the QD SOA. It is clearly illustrated that stronger pump gives larger group index reduction. By fitting the experimental data based on our theory,

Fig. 8: (a) Experimental results of the phase delay and (b) absorbance due to excitonic CPO in GaAs/AlGaAs QWs. The theoretical result in (b) agrees well with the experimental in (a). (c) The theoretical slowdown factor as a function of the detuning frequency between the signal and pump. The peak slowdown factor agrees with the value extracted from the experiment.

we extract the peak group-index changes and their bandwidth. The decrease of group index varies from \(-0.08\) to \(-0.28\) when the optical pump output changes from 12 to 30 mW. The FWHM of the spectral hole in the transmission (gain) spectrum induced by CPO (or the CPO bandwidth) is in the range of 11.5 to 13 GHz. We also observe that, as the optical pump power increases, the overall background phase delay is changed in addition to the CPO effect.

### _Slow Light in the Absorption Regime--Reverse and Small Forward Bias: [29, 31, 32]_

When a QD-SOA is under a reverse bias [31], or under a small forward bias current below the transparent current level [29], the net effect is an absorptive WG. Under such conditions, slow light effects have been observed. The observation of CPO in a counter-propagating pump and probe laser setup is achieved by RF-phase shift experiment. The measurement utilizes the pump \((\lambda=\sim\)\(1291\) nm, \(\text{Power}=8\) dBm) and an RF modulated (at 1 GHz) tunable laser diode as the probe. Both signals are injected via fiber tips, circulator, and polarization controller into the opposite sides of the QD-EA modulator \((L=750\)\(\mu\)m). The magnitude and phase of the modulated probe signal at port 1 of optical network analyzer is compared to the response after the QD-EA modulator at input port 2. In our experiment the QD-EA modulator is kept at temperature equal to 20 \({}^{\circ}\)C. Clear electroabsorption effects in the reverse bias region \((V<0)\) with QD bound state absorption have been observed. The increase in absorption is especially visible near the ground state of the QD under reverse bias.

In the presence of an external pump light, the carrier population oscillates with a frequency determined by the detuning between the pump and probe laser wavelength. The dispersive interaction modifies the absorption and, therefore, the group index experienced by the probe beam. RF phase measurements directly reveal the group index change due to pump-probe interaction. In the reverse bias regime (from 0 to \(-3.8\) V), Fig. 10(a) shows a reduction of slow light even though the background absorption increases (due to electroabsorption effects) with a linewidth broadening. The reason is likely due to the fast carrier sweep out of QDs under a reverse bias or shorter interband carrier life time, and, therefore, broader bandwidth (determined by \(1/T_{1}\) and the Rabi frequency of the pump intensity). A phase change of 2\({}^{\circ}\) at 1 GHz corresponds to 5.6-ps delay or a group index change of 2.2 and a slow down factor of about 5.7 relative to vacuum. Optical control of slow light by varying the optical pump power was also achieved. In the forward bias current regime when the current is below the transparent current of 30 mA (at which the modal gain is balanced by the modal loss), the WG is still absorptive, and the slow light effect has also been observed [Fig. 10(b)]. The relative RF phase change decreases with increasing bias current since the net modal absorption reduces to zero at 30 mA.

## IV Slow and Fast Light Using FWM and CPO in QW-SOAs

### _Physical Principle_

In this section, we discuss experiments and theory using nearly degenerate FWM (NDFWM) effects in SOAs. The major difference from Section III is that both signal and pump beams are coupled into the same SOA WG and propagate in the same direction.

The theory of FWM in SOAs has been studied extensively [42]. FWM between a strong pump beam and a weak probe beam in an SOA results in carrier density pulsations at the difference frequency (i.e., detuning frequency), \(\Omega=\omega_{\text{s}}-\omega_{\text{p}}=2\pi\delta\). This leads to creation of gain and refractive index gratings at the detuning frequency. The gratings, in turn, lead to two effects: the modification of the dispersion relationship for the probe [12, 13] and the generation of a conjugate signal at \(\omega_{\text{p}}-\Omega\)[43]. The modification of the probe dispersion implies change of the group refractive index for the probe. This effect has the same origin as that discussed in Section III, but a significantly larger delay can be obtained due to a stronger interaction between the copropagating pump and probe beams. The generation of a conjugate signal requires phase matching of the pump and probe (copropagation is necessary) and a gain medium. The

Fig. 10: Experimental (symbols) and theoretical (lines) relative phase change spectra as a function of the pump–probe detuning frequency for (a) reverse bias, and (b) forward bias of the QD-SOA, where the transparency current of the QD-SOA is 30 mA. Both cases are in the regime where the device has a net absorption (or the next modal gain is negative) [32].

conjugate signal can create adverse effects to the detection of a slowed probe beam, as discussed in the next section.

Unique to a semiconductor gain medium, both slow and fast light can be achieved depending on the frequency detuning, due to a large linewidth enhancement factor. Our recent theoretical studies [12, 13] and experimental demonstrations [14] showed that slow light for the probe beam can be achieved in SOA for negative frequency detuning while fast light can be achieved for positive frequency detuning. Hence, the group delay of the signal can be controlled electrically by changing the SOA bias and optically by changing the pump power or pump-probe detuning. In the following, we review our recent results.

### _Theoretical Calculations_

FWM between the pump and probe beams in SOA creates a conjugate at the frequency \(\omega_{\mathrm{conj}}=2\omega_{\mathrm{p}}-\omega_{\mathrm{s}}\). For small positive frequency detuning, the conjugate power at the output can be higher than the probe power, as indicated by the theory of FWM in SOA [12]. Assuming that the conjugate signal is negligible in comparison with the probe at the output of the SOA, slow and fast light in SOA can be obtained [13] as a function of detuning, as indicated by the dotted curve in Fig. 11 (\(\tau_{\mathrm{S}}\) is the carrier lifetime in the SOA). Based on the general theory of FWM [13], we calculated the probe propagation in SOA taking into account the influence of generated conjugate signal, as indicated by the long-dashed curve in Fig. 13. It is clear that the generated conjugate signal is also modulated, and the modulation in the conjugate wave propagates in the SOA with a delay. In experiments, due to the difficulty to optically separate the probe and conjugate for very small detuning values, the observed signal contains both the modulated probe and the modulated conjugate, as exhibited by the solid curve.

From Fig. 11, the conjugate signal generation is suppressed completely, the dependence of the delay on the detuning is "asymmetric" (positive delay at \(\Omega<0\), and negative delay at \(\Omega>0\)). The inclusion of conjugate signal leads to "symmetrization" of the dependence. This is because the conjugate power was significantly lower than that of the probe to begin with. The asymmetry, thus, depends on saturation power and SOA gain, as well as pump power.

### _Experimental Demonstration_

The experimental setup includes a QW SOA with 28-dB fiber-to-fiber unsaturated gain, 13-dBm saturation power, and 1.52-1.57-\(\mu\)m operating band. The outputs of two DFB lasers are used as the pump and probe, respectively. The probe is modulated by a LiNbO\({}_{3}\) external modulator before being combined with the pump by a fiber directional coupler. Typically, the probe power is maintained at least 10 dB lower than the pump power to avoid the possibility of gain saturation change due to the probe. A bandpass electrical filter (\(0.5\sim 1\) GHz) is used to select the modulation frequency component and suppress all the beating components between the pump, probe and conjugate. Both single-tone and pulsed modulation were used and tunable delays were measured.

#### Iv-C1 Single-Tone Time-Domain Measurements

Fig. 12 shows tunable delay of a sinusoidally modulated signal. The probe beam is externally modulated to produce a sinusoidal signal at the desired frequency. The amplitude of modulation is maintained well below the saturation power of SOA to avoid gain fluctuations due to modulated signal. Fig. 12 shows time-domain traces of a detected modulated signal for different values of the detuning \(\Omega\). As expected from the theory (Fig. 11), the delay/advancement, measured relatively to the trace, obtained for large (\(-150\) GHz) pump-probe detuning, is nonzero only if the detuning is not very large in comparison with the inverse carrier lifetime (\(\sim\)1 ns). This behavior is related to the origin of the delay which is FWM via carrier density pulsations, which take place only at the small detuning values. Both slow light and fast light are observed as the detuning is varied from negative values to positive values. Considering both the delay and the advancement of the signal, a maximum tunable range of 1.6 ns is observed for a 0.5-GHz signal. This corresponds to an RF Phase change of \(1.6\pi\), or a DBP of 0.8.

Fig. 11: Delay as a function of detuning for three different scenarios. In the first scenario (dotted curve), the generation of the conjugate is suppressed. In the second scenario (long-dashed curve), both probe and conjugate coexist at the output but only probe is detected. In a more realistic scenario (solid curve), both probe and conjugate are detected at output.

Fig. 12: Oscilloscope time traces of the modulated probe signal (0.5 GHz) for different detuning values. Pump power at the input of the SOA is 9 dBm and the probe dc power is \(-3\) dBm. As the detuning decreases, the time delay/advancement is increased.

Fig. 13 shows the delay as function of detuning for different values of the pump power. Higher pump power results in more efficient FWM and hence larger delay. However, if the pump power is much higher than the saturation power of SOA (\(>\) 13 dB), then the gain of the SOA decreases resulting in smaller delays. Further, slow light is observed at small positive detuning due to the contribution from the conjugate (compare with Fig. 11).

#### V-C2 Pulsed Time-Domain Measurements

A bit-error-rate test set (HP70841) was used to generate 1.3-ns electrical pulses. The square pulses are subsequently shaped using an electrical filter to achieve an optimum shape suitable for pulse measurements. The pulses are not transform-limited and, hence, its bandwidth is not optimized for the SOA slow light device. The electrical pulses are fed to an external Mach-Zehnder modulator where the CW probe light is modulated to generate the optical pulses.

Fig. 14 shows the output time traces of the pulse as the detuning is varied. The pump power at the input of the SOA is 3 dBm and the probe average power is \(-9\) dBm. The middle trace with a large detuning (\(-50\) GHz) serves as the reference. Both slow light (\(-3.13\) GHz) and fast light (\(+5.00\) GHz) are observed as the detuning is changed. However, the pulse shape distorts significantly at a small detuning value (\(+5.00\) GHz), resulting in a dip at the trailing edge. A total delay of 0.59 ns is attained with a corresponding DBP of 0.46. The enhanced distortion and reduced DBP are likely to be due to cross-gain modulation between the probe and the pump beams. Further study is currently underway to understand and reduce the effect of cross gain modulation.

The SOA bias can be used to tune the optical delay. The measurements are performed for a pump power of \(0\) dBm and a probe power of \(-11\) dBm at a detuning of \(-3\) GHz. Fig. 15 shows that the delay increases with SOA current, resulting from a higher SOA gain and creating a stronger beating between the pump and the probe. However, the gain of the SOA does not increase significantly at higher SOA bias and reaches a maximum value at 300 mA. At this bias, increasing the SOA current does not increase the gain significantly as the SOA operates in saturation regime.

We show that tunable delay at room temperature can be achieved by tuning the wavelength of the pump, by changing the power of the pump, or by changing the SOA bias. For a 1.3-ns pulse, a tunable delay exceeding 0.59 ns is demonstrated, corresponding to a smaller DBP of 0.45. A smaller DBP is obtained for pulsed measurements comparing with single-tone sinusoidal measurements [14]. There is evidence that the cross-gain modulation of the pump beam may be a very important factor for the discrepancy and is now under investigation.

### _Single-Beam Frequency-Domain Measurements of CPO and FWM in QW-SOA [15, 16]_

Slow and fast light in a high-gain QW SOA with CPO and NDFWM effects have recently been reported [15, 16]. The experiment utilizes a single microwave-modulated optical pump beam. CPO and NDFWM in SOA have been intensely studied [43, 44]. There is an advantage of using only a single beam with RF modulation induced side bands as the probe. Ultimately, this mimics the ideal slow light device setup without the use of an external pump. A theoretical model based on the mean-field approximation is used so that the spatial dependence of the optical fields can be ignored. An analytical solution for the gain and phase delay of an optical microwave signal has been found [15]. The model agrees well with experimental

Fig. 14: Oscilloscope time traces of pulse for different detuning values. Pump input power to SOA is 3-dBm probe dc power is \(-9\) dBm. A maximum tunable delay of 0.59 ns is observed. The pulse undergoes significant distortion at small detuning values.

results in a QW semiconductor WG. Based on the model, a design criterion for maximum delay-bandwidth using CPO and MDFWM in SOAs has also been proposed [15].

The experimental setup and physical picture of variable delay of a microwave modulated beam in QW-SOAs are given in Fig. 16. A DFB laser is used as the pump beam modulated by the network analyzer with a continuously sweeping microwave frequency. This generates two sidebands in addition to the dc component of the output spectrum. The three electrical field components induce CPO and MDFWM in the QW SOA. This configuration also indicates that both CPO and FWM effects are important and they should be taken into account properly in our theory [15].

In Fig. 17, we present experimental (symbols) gain and delay spectra of the optical signal and theoretical models (solid curves) from [15]. The model correctly predicts the behavior of experimental data with increasing electrical current injection into the QW-SOA. In the case of optical delay, the \(\sim\)100-mA current injection (transparency current) is used as a reference (zero delay). It has been observed that the delay decreases as the current injection increases, leading to an optical advance (or negative delay). A maximum electrical variable delay of 83 ps with about 1-GHz bandwidth is achieved, as shown in Fig. 17. From the measured bandwidths, it is found that the carrier lifetime in the device decreases from 380 to 240 ps, which is reasonable for typical SOAs, as the current increases from 150 to 400 mA.

## V Figures of Merit (FOM)

There has been much interest in developing a set of universal FOM to compare the tradeoff between various schemes to attain slow light--in particular, the DBP, storage density or device size, and power consumption. We recently analyzed the first two parameters analytically by considering a device with a hole in its absorption spectra [36]. Similar delay-bandwidth analyses are published for CPO and other physical mechanisms [35]. A common conclusion seems to arrive from a number of different authors to lead to a DBP limit of the order of 2. For the absorbers, the maximal delay time will be limited by the residual loss experienced by the signal as well as pulse distortion due to the loss spectra. On the other hand, for SOAs, the maximal delay will be limited by a reasonable SOA gain that can be experienced by the signal (\(25\sim 30\) dB), which is in turned limited by the beating noise of signal and amplified spontaneous emission. As such, the limitation on the SOA gain limits the number of stored bits to a value between one and two [36].

Yet a more relevant question is the tradeoff between bit rate and DBP for a given acceptable power penalty. We have recently numerically simulated the bit-error-rate performance for various links [37]. For an absorption-based device, the DBP is typically shown to scale linearly with \(L\) since DBP \(=\Delta\alpha L/2\pi\)[36]. Here, the bandwidth is taken as FWHM of the absorption coefficient \(\Delta a\). However, for a WG device, the bandwidth is more appropriately calculated from the transmission through the medium, which is proportional to \(\exp(-\alpha L)\). We showed that within the range of device lengths that are of interest (\(1\) mm \(<L<100\) mm), the transmission bandwidth is actually proportional to \(L^{-1/2}\). Hence, with the delay being proportional to \(L\), the delay-bandwidth product is proportional to \(L^{1/2}\). The DBP-bandwidth is thus a constant and has no \(L\) dependence. We showed that a given system with a given power penalty will have a DBP-bandwidth product value, which can be used as an FOM.

Power consumption is an important FOM. However, it is also the most complicated one that depends tremendously on assumptions employed in making the comparisons. It is a subject that is currently under study.

## VI Conclusion

In conclusion, we have discussed recent progress on slow and fast light using semiconductor QW and QD devices. Significant progress has been made during the last few years from very low temperature to room temperature operation. CPO and FWM effects have been used in QW and QD SOAs under either forward or reverse biased conditions. Both electrical and optical controls of slow light in frequency as well as time domain measurements have been demonstrated. Challenging issues such as increasing
