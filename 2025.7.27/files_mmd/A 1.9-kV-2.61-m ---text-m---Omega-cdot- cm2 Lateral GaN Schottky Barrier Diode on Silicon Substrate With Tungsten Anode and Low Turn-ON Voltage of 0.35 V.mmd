## I Introduction

GaN based devices are capable of delivering superior high power density and high efficiency for both DC and RF applications due to the formation of a 2-dimensional-electron-gas (2DEG) channel, high electron mobility and saturation velocity as well as breakdown field of 3.4 MV/cm [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Recently, GaN on silicon power device is considered as a promising low cost and high efficiency candidate to substitute for the Si based power transistors in some particular breakdown voltage (BV) ranges [6]. Meanwhile, the Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) with a low turn-on voltage (\(V_{\text{on}}\)), high forward current density and fast switching speed property are ideal for low switching/conduction losses and high frequency operations, which are indispensible components in power electronic circuits such as converters and inverters for power supplies and power factor corrections. Recent progresses in achieving high performance GaN SBDs including a record low \(V_{\text{on}}\) of 0.2 V and low \(V_{\text{on}}\) of 0.3 \(\sim\) 0.6 V with record high BV of 1 kV \(\sim\) 2.07 kV and high power figure-of-merit (FOM) of \(1.1\times 10^{3}\) MW/cm\({}^{2}\)[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]. In terms of structure innovation of GaN SBD, lateral GaN SBDs with the AlGaN barrier layer partial or fully recess at anode regions and gated Ohmic metal with dual anode structures have all achieved state-of-art performances [9]. For the anode metal selection for lateral GaN SBDs, various metals were adopted such as Ni [7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 21, 24, 26, 27, 28], Pt [11, 22, 25], TiN [23], and Ti [29]. For the vertical GaN SBDs, Pt [14], Ni [15, 16, 17, 18, 19] and TiN [20] were commonly used.

To achieve a low \(V_{\text{on}}\) on a lateral GaN SBD, we propose to use Tungsten (W) anode, whose work function is approximately 4.6 eV, which is around 0.5 eV lower compared with a commonly used anode Ni. Meanwhile, W can also provide enough barrier height to block the reverse leakage current and hence guarantee a high reverse BV. In this letter, we have used W as the anode with a fully recessed AlGaN barrier at the anode region, which demonstrates a low \(V_{\text{on}}\) of 0.35 V with ultrahigh uniformity. Lateral GaN SBDs also demonstrate a high BV of 1.1 kV and 1.9 kV with simultaneous low differential specific on-resistances (\(R_{\text{on},\text{sp}}\)) of 0.72 mQ-cm\({}^{2}\) and 2.61 mG-cm\({}^{2}\), respectively, yielding a high power FOM of 1.7 \(\times 10^{3}\) MW/cm\({}^{2}\) and \(1.4\times 10^{3}\) MW/cm\({}^{2}\) at the \(L_{\text{AC}}\) of 10 \(\mu\)m and 25 \(\mu\)m, respectively. This shows the great promise of the lateral GaN SBD with the W anode as power electronic devices.

## II Device Fabrication and Measurement

The GaN HEMT epitaxy substrate was grown on a Si substrate consisting of a 4 \(\mu\)m-thick carbon-doped buffer layer, a 300 nm i-GaN channel, a 1 nm AlN spacer, a 20 nm Al\({}_{0.25}\)Ga\({}_{0.75}\)N barrier and a 2 nm GaN capping layer by metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). Fig. 1 shows the detailed layer structures of the lateral GaN SBD with the W anode on the Si substrate. Device fabrication commenced with mesa isolation by Cl\({}_{2}\)/BCl\({}_{3}\) etching to a depth of 200 nm. Then, Ohmic contacts or Cathodes were formed by depositing Ti/Al/Ni/Au (20/140/45/55 nm) followed by a rapid thermal anneal (RTA) at 875 \({}^{\circ}\)C for 30 s in an N\({}_{2}\) atmosphere. The Ohmic contact resistance (R\({}_{\text{C}}\)) and sheet resistance (R\({}_{\rm SH}\)) were extracted to be 0.5 \(\Omega\)-mm and 310 \(\Omega\)/\(\square\), respectively, through the transfer length method (TLM). After that, the GaN capping layer, AlGaN barrier layer and AlN spacer at anode regions were completely etched through a low damage Cl\({}_{2}\)/BCl\({}_{3}\) etching process with an etch rate of approximately 1.3 nm/min. The total recess depth was approximately 37 nm, which was confirmed by an atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurement. The Schottky contacts or anodes at the recessed regions were formed by sputtering W/Au (50/150 nm), which was followed with an RTA process at 450 \({}^{\circ}\)C. Finally, 20 nm of Al\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) was deposited on the device surface as the passivation layer through atomic layer deposition (ALD). The fabricated circular SBDs had an anode radius of 60 \(\mu\)m and various L\({}_{\rm ACS}\) from 6 \(\mu\)m to 25 \(\mu\)m. The forward DC measurements were carried out with a Keithley 4200 Semiconductor Parameter Analyzer, and the reverse breakdown measurements were performed using an Agilent B1505A high-voltage semiconductor analyzer system.

## III Results and Discussion

Fig. 2(a) shows the well-behaved DC forward characteristics (I-V) of lateral GaN SBDs with various L\({}_{\rm ACS}\) from 6 \(\mu\)m to 25 \(\mu\)m. The forward bias is swept from 0 V to 2 V with 0.01 V as a step. The normalized maximum anode current (I\({}_{\rm MAX}\)) at a forward bias of 2V is 325 mA/mm, 250 mA/mm, 202 mA/mm, 175 mA/mm and 150 mA/mm at an L\({}_{\rm AC}\) of 6 \(\mu\)m, 10 \(\mu\)m, 15 \(\mu\)m, 20 \(\mu\)m and 25 \(\mu\)m, respectively. The differential on-resistance (R\({}_{\rm on1}\), as shown in Fig. 1(a)) is calculated to be 4.22 \(\Omega\)-mm, 5.6 \(\Omega\)-mm, 6.87 \(\Omega\)-mm, 8.14 \(\Omega\)-mm and 9.34 \(\Omega\)-mm, respectively. On the other hand, the on-resistance (R\({}_{\rm on2}\)) can also be defined at the forward current density of 100 mA/mm (as illustrated in Fig. 1(a)) by considering the influence of the turn-on voltage (V\({}_{\rm on}\)), thus yielding R\({}_{\rm on2}\) = 10 \(\Omega\)-mm, 11.46 \(\Omega\)-mm, 12.6 \(\Omega\)-mm, 13.8 \(\Omega\)-mm and 15 \(\Omega\)-mm, respectively. The V\({}_{\rm on}\) defined at the anode forward current density of 1 mA/mm for the SBD is 0.35 V with a negligible variation among devices with different LAC. This ultralow V\({}_{\rm on}\) is comparable to those SBDs with a partially recessed AlGaN barrier, and it is generally more than 0.3 V lower than those GaN SBDs with a fully recessed AlGaN barrier and Ni anode. Fig. 2(b) is the log-scale plot of the I-V curves for various L\({}_{\rm ACS}\), which is the same as Fig. 2(a). A decent current on/off ratio as high as 10\({}^{8}\) is achieved, although the work function of W is only 4.6 eV. The subthreshold slope (SS) is extracted to be 63 mV/dec, which is close to the ideal SS = 60 mV/dec, thus showing a high-quality Schottky interface. Those I-V curves overlap with each other at the current level of 10\({}^{-6}\) mA/mm to 1 mA/mm, thus indicating an ultrahigh uniformity of the Schottky junction such that, at this subthreshold region, the series resistance has negligible influences. For the forward bias, the I-V relationship can be expressed as I = I\({}_{\rm s}\times\)[exp(q \(\times\) (V - I\(\times\)R\({}_{\rm s}\))/\(\eta\)kT-1)], where \(R\)\({}_{\rm s}\) is the series resistance, T is the absolute temperature, k is the Boltzmann constant, \(\eta\) is the ideality factor, and I\({}_{\rm s}\) is the reverse saturation current. The \(\eta\) and I\({}_{\rm s}\) can be determined from the slope and intercept of the In-V plots, respectively. Meanwhile, the Schottky barrier height (\(\varphi_{\rm b}\)) can be expressed by the equation \(\varphi_{\rm b}\) = (kT/q) \(\times\) ln(AA\({}^{\star}\)T\({}_{2}\)/I\({}_{\rm s}\)), where A is the diode area and A\({}^{\star}\) is the Richard constant [30]. The \(\varphi_{b}\) and \(\eta\) are determined to be 0.65 eV and 1.08, respectively, at the barrier-limited region. Fig. 2(c) and 2(d) are the T-dependent log-scale forward and reverse I-V characteristics with L\({}_{\rm AC}\) = 10 \(\mu\)m from T = 25 \({}^{\circ}\)C to 150 \({}^{\circ}\)C, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2(c), even at T = 150 \({}^{\circ}\)C, a decent on/off ratio as high as 10\({}^{6}\) and a near ideal SS = 87 mV/dec are achieved, thus verifying a high-quality Schottky interface. Meanwhile, when compared to the reverse I at T = 25 \({}^{\circ}\)C, it is only increased by 6X at T = 150 \({}^{\circ}\)C, which is comparable to the lateral GaN SBD with the Ni anode [8]. As aforementioned, the \(\varphi_{\rm b}\) is 0.65 eV, which is only 0.05 eV lower when compared with the SBD with the Ni anode, despite a 0.5 eV work function difference between W and Ni, thus indicating a more ideal Schottky interface between the W anode and GaN channel. Therefore, the low V\({}_{\rm on}\) originates from the low work function of W and the high reverse blocking capability comes from the high-quality Schottky interface with a sufficient \(\varphi_{\rm b}\)[8]. Fig. 2(e) depicts the pulse measurements of the same device

Fig. 2: Room-T forward I-V characteristics in (a) linear-scale and (b) log-scale plots of the fabricated lateral GaN-on-Si SBDs with fully recessed AlGaN barrier, W anode and various L\({}_{\rm AC}\). High = 325 mA/mm at \(V\) = 2 V and L\({}_{\rm AC}\) = 6 nm is achieved. The R\({}_{\rm on}\) can be defined into two ways, including the differential R\({}_{\rm on1}\) and R\({}_{\rm on2}\) at 1 = 100 mA/mm, as shown in Fig. 2(a). T-dependent (c) log-scale toward I-V and (d) reverse I-V characteristics of the lateral GaN SBD with L\({}_{\rm AC}\) = 10 \(\mu\)m from the T = 25 \({}^{\circ}\)C to 150 \({}^{\circ}\)C.

as in Fig. 2(c) with the anode pulse width and pulse period of 500 \(\mu\)s and 500 ms, respectively. The anode pulse quiescent bias points are set to be 0 V, \(-\)10 V, \(-\)20 V, \(-\)30 V, \(-\)40 V, \(-\)60 V and \(-\)80 V. Fig. 2(f) shows the extracted R\({}_{\text{on}}\) at various anode pulse bases. Compared with the 0 V pulsed forward 1 and R\({}_{\text{on}}\), there is around an 80% forward I collapse and an 80% R\({}_{\text{on}}\) increase at the anode pulse base of \(-\)80 V, thus indicating that an optimized passivation layer is needed to avoid the pulsed R\({}_{\text{on}}\) degradation.

Fig. 3(a) is the I-V measurements summary of 80 devices with L\({}_{\text{AC}}\) = 10 \(\mu\)m, which are randomly picked from 3 samples with each sample area being 3 cm \(\times\) 3 cm. An ultrahigh V\({}_{\text{on}}\) uniformity is achieved with a negligible V\({}_{\text{on}}\) variation. Fig. 3(b) is the histogram statistics of V\({}_{\text{on}}\), which were extracted at I = 1 mA/mm. The mean value of V\({}_{\text{on}}\) is 0.355 V with a standard deviation of 0.0068 V, which presents an ultrahigh uniformity phenomenon. When comparing the lateral GaN SBD with the partially recessed AlGaN barrier, it lacks self-termination or the uniformity is significantly influenced by the remaining AlGaN barrier thickness, thus leading to an obvious V\({}_{\text{on}}\) variation. On the other hand, once the AlGaN barrier layer is removed, the V\({}_{\text{on}}\) is primarily dominated by the work function difference between the W anode and the GaN channel layer. We increased the anode recess depth to 70 nm, and the V\({}_{\text{on}}\) is only 0.4 V, thus verifying that the recess depth has negligible influences on the V\({}_{\text{on}}\) once the AlGaN barrier is completely removed.

Fig. 4(a) presents the room T reverse I-V measurements to study its breakdown characteristics. During the measurement, the cathode is grounded, and the anode is reversely biased until the SBD possesses a hard breakdown or the reverse I approaches 1 mA/mm. Our SBDs are capable of demonstrating a high reverse BV of 0.6 kV, 1.1 kV, 1.25 kV, 1.5 kV and 1.9 kV at an L\({}_{\text{AC}}\) of 6 \(\mu\)m, 10 \(\mu\)m, 15 \(\mu\)m, 20 \(\mu\)m and 25 \(\mu\)m, respectively. We performed breakdown measurements on the other 3 lateral GaN SBDs with L\({}_{\text{AC}}\) = 25 \(\mu\)m, and all of them show a similar BV = 1.9 kV. The R\({}_{\text{on},\text{sp}}\) at various L\({}_{\text{AC}}\)s is plotted in Fig. 4(b) based on the two aforementioned criteria, namely, the differential R\({}_{\text{on},\text{sp}}\) and the R\({}_{\text{on},\text{sp}}\) at a forward I = 100 mA/mm, considering a 1.5 \(\mu\)m transfer length of Ohmic contact and a 1.5 \(\mu\)m extension length of the Schottky contact in the active area calculation. Coming with the BV, the power FOM (= BV\({}^{2}\)/R\({}_{\text{on},\text{sp}}\)) is determined to be 1/1.7/1.3/1.2/1.4 GW/cm\({}^{2}\) and 0.5/0.9/0.8/0.8/0.9 GW/cm\({}^{2}\) (or \(\times 10^{3}\) MW/cm\({}^{2}\)) for differential R\({}_{\text{on},\text{sp}}\) and R\({}_{\text{on},\text{sp}}\) at 100 mA/mm, respectively, at their corresponding L\({}_{\text{AC}}\)s of 6/10/15/20/25 \(\mu\)m. To the best of our knowledge, this \(1.7\times 10^{3}\) MW/cm\({}^{2}\) for the differential R\({}_{\text{on},\text{sp}}\) is the highest among all the lateral GaN SBDs on the Si substrate. The performance of our lateral GaN SBDs are benchmarked against some state-of-the-art lateral GaN SBDs (as shown in Fig. 4(c)) and both lateral and vertical GaN SBDs (as shown in Fig. 4(d) and 4(e)) in the plot of R\({}_{\text{on},\text{sp}}\) with both definitions versus BV [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]. The difference between Fig. 4(d) and Fig. 4(e) is that Fig. 4(d) is incorporating Ohmic contact transfer length and Schottky contact extension length of 1.5 \(\mu\)m into the lateral diode active area calculation, while Fig. 4(e) is utilizing the whole diode area of lateral GaN SBDs, which is the same as the vertical GaN SBDs. Our GaN SBDs with the W anode possess the best BV\(\sim\)R\({}_{\text{on},\text{sp}}\) performances among all lateral GaN SBDs on the Si substrate and are comparable to the state-of-the-art lateral GaN SBDs on the SiC, thus showing their great potential for power electronic applications.

## IV Conclusion

We have experimentally demonstrated the high-performance lateral GaN SBDs with the W anode. Even with a fully recessed AlGaN barrier at the anode region, a low V\({}_{\text{on}}\) of 0.35 V with an ultrahigh uniformity has been achieved due to the low work function of W, which can still provide enough barrier height for the reverse leakage current blocking. A high power FOM of \(1.7\times 10^{3}\) MW/cm\({}^{2}\) with BV = 1.1 kV and differential R\({}_{\text{on},\text{sp}}\) = 0.72 m\(\Omega\)-cm\({}^{2}\) is achieved at an L\({}_{\text{AC}}\) = 10 \(\mu\)m. Meanwhile, a high BV of 1.9 kV is demonstrated with a power FOM of \(1.4\times 10^{3}\) MW/cm\({}^{2}\) and a differential R\({}_{\text{on},\text{sp}}\) of 2.61 m\(\Omega\)-cm\({}^{2}\) at an L\({}_{\text{AC}}\) = 25 \(\mu\)m. The lateral GaN SBDs with the W anode, high V\({}_{\text{on}}\) uniformity, high current on/off ratio, high BV, high power FOM and low R\({}_{\text{on},\text{sp}}\), thus demonstrating their great potential as future high-performance power rectifiers.
