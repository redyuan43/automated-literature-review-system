###### Abstract

The paper discusses the application of the classical digital signal processing algorithms to the problem of the measuring a time interval between two pulses. The value of the measured interval is determined by the position of the maximum of the cross-correlation function of two impulse responses of Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) filters. The responses of the SAW filters are sampled at a lower frequency, which reduces requirements to an analog-to-digital converter. In post-processing, the response sampling rate can be increased to an arbitrarily large value. Increasing the sampling rate improves the resolution in determining the value of the time interval being measured. The Cross-Correlation Function (CCF) of two responses is calculated at the increased frequency using the discrete Fourier transform. The search for the maximum of the CCF is performed on its envelope, calculated through the discrete Hilbert transform. The position of the maximum of the CCF is further refined due to the local interpolation of the envelope by a polynomial of even degree. The results of the algorithms are demonstrated using the real responses of a SAW filter.

## I Introduction

A Time to Digital Converter (TDC) is designed to obtain a digital value of the duration of the time interval between two successive electrical impulses [1]. The beginning of the measured time interval is considered to be the moment of occurrence of the front of one of the pulses designated as the initial one. The moment of the appearance of the front of another pulse (final) indicates the end of the measured time interval. If the edge of the initial pulse occurs before the final one, then the measured time interval is considered positive, otherwise it is negative one. The time interval is zero if the edges of both the pulses occur simultaneously.

The high resolution (around 10 ps) in the digital value of the measured time interval can be obtained through an analog pulse expansion. In this approach, at the moments of the appearance of the fronts of the initial and final pulses, two analog signals of the same shape are created, which undergo synchronous Analog-to-Digital Conversion (ADC). The duration of these analog signals is many times longer than the ADC sampling period. The time interval between pulses is obtained from the position of the maximum of the cross-correlation function calculated between the digitized analog signals.

In [2,3], it was proposed to use a Surface Acoustic Waves (SAW) filter as an analog pulse expander. The SAW filter is a bandpass filter with the sharp passband boundaries and the extremely high stopband rejection. The pulse response of the SAW filter has a rather complex shape. Therefore, the maximum of the Cross Correlation Function (CCF) of the responses of two identical SAW filters is clearly distinguished by means of digital signal processing. The frequency properties of the SAW filter allow the analog-to-digital conversion at a frequency below the Nyquist rate. Using digital methods, the sampling frequency of the SAW filter's output signal can be increased to an arbitrarily large value. Those the sampling period can be made arbitrarily small, which means that the position of the maximum CCF between the responses of the SAW filter to the initial and final pulses can be determined with an arbitrarily high resolution.

This paper describes a set of algorithms for the digital signal processing in the TDC using SAW filters. Analog signals at the outputs of SAW filters are sampled at the reduced frequency. The sampling rate is then digitally increased to improve the resolution of the TDC. The CCF between the responses of the SAW filters is calculated at the upsampled frequency using the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). The CCF contains strong oscillations at the center frequency of the SAW filter's passband. Therefore, the maximum of the CCF is found at the maximum of its envelope, obtained through the discrete Hilbert transform.

The results of the algorithms are demonstrated on the impulse response of a real SAW filter with the center frequency \(\alpha_{\mathrm{ap}}=70\) MHz and the passband \(\Delta\alpha_{\mathrm{ap}}=2\) MHz at the level of 3dB and the group delay \(T_{\mathrm{GD}}=2\) usec. The record of the filter's response sampled at the sampling frequency \(f_{s}=26.66\) MHz or with the sampling period \(T_{3}=1/f_{s}=37.51\) ns-is processed.

## II The SAW-based TDC Operation Principles

### _TDC Block Diagram_

A simplified block diagram of the TDC using SAW filters is shown in Fig. 1. The TDC contains two identical channels, "Start" and "Stop". The initial pulse STR of the time interval is applied to the input of the "Start" channel, and the final pulse STP is applied to the input of the "Stop" channel. The leading edges of the input pulses are differentiated and amplified to produce the short (but wideband) excitation pulses for the SAW filters of the same type. The responses of the SAW filters are synchronously sampled by the identical ADCs with a common clock signal. If the exciting pulses in the "Start" and "Stop" channelsoccur at the instants \(I_{STR}\) and \(I_{STP}\), then the measured interval between them is \(\Delta t=t_{STP}-t_{STP}\).

Let the \(h_{STR}(t)\)  and \(h_{STP}(t)\) are the pulse responses of the SAW filters of the same type in the Start and Stop channels, and \(h_{STR}(t)\approx h_{STP}(t)\). The responses at the outputs of the SAW filters occur at the moments of arrival of the exciting pulses. These responses are described by the shifted pulse responses \(h_{STR}(t-t_{STR})\)  and \(h_{STP}(t-t_{STP})\). The cross-correlation between these responses is

\[k(\tau)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}h_{STR}(t-t_{STR}-\tau)h_{STP}(t-t_{STP})\ dt\,\]

where \(\tau\) is the shift of one signal relative to another. The impulse responses of the filters are similar, so the correlation function reaches the maximum when they are completely superimposed, i.e. with the values of the arguments \(-t_{STR}-t_{\max}=-t_{STP}\). From here \(\tau_{\max}=t_{STP}-t_{STR}=\Delta t\). Thus, to measure the time interval between these pulses, it is necessary to determine the value of the argument \(\tau\) at which the CCF reaches its maximum value.

### _Pulse Response of the SAW Filter_

The SAW filter is an analog transversal narrowband filter, with the ideal pulse response \(\bar{h}_{sAW}(t)\), which may be expressed as [4]

\[\bar{h}_{sAW}(t)=\bar{h}_{sAW}(t-T_{OB})\ w_{H}(t)\,\]

where \(w_{H}(t)=0.54-0.46\cos\left(2\pi t\ /\ T_{W}\right)\) is the Hamming window of duration \(T_{W}=2T_{OB}\) ; \(\bar{h}_{sAW}(t)\) is the pulse response of an ideal bandpass filter with a central frequency \(\omega_{BP}\) and a band \(\Delta\omega_{BP}\)

\[\bar{h}_{sAW}(t)=\mathrm{sinc}(0.5\ \Delta\omega_{BP}t)\cos\omega_{BP}t\.\]

Hereafter the notation \(\mathrm{sinc}(x)=\mathrm{sin}(x)/x\) is used. The frequency response of the ideal SAW-filter is symmetrical relative to \(\omega_{BP}\), and its value outside the bandwidth is less than -45 dB. A set of the frequency responses of the bandpass filters with the parameters of the real SAW-filter used in this work are shown in Fig.2. The frequency response of an ideal bandpass filter is depicted after the superimposing a rectangular window with a duration \(T_{W}\) on the pulse response \(\bar{h}_{sAW}(t-T_{OB})\) [5].

In the industrial manufacturing of the SAW-filters, manufacturing errors occur in the spatial structure of the transversal elements. As a result, the frequency response of the filter is deformed, and the transmission coefficient of the filter in the suppression band turns out to be somewhat higher than it could be obtained with the exact implementation of the window function \(w_{H}(t)\). In the pulsed reaction of the SAW-filter, several parasitic responses occur due to edge effects in the crystal. The superimposition of graphs of the impulse responses of the ideal and the real SAW filters with frequency response on Fig.2 is shown in Fig. 3.

## III Conversion of the Sampling Rate of Narrowband Signals

### _Sampling of Narrowband Signals_

Suppose there is a narrow-band analog signal \(s(t)\). The spectrum \(S(\omega)\) of this signal is concentrated in the frequency band \([\omega_{BP}-\Delta\omega_{Lo},\omega_{BP}+\Delta\omega_{BP}]\), where \(\Delta\omega_{Lo}\), \(\Delta\omega_{BP}\) are the left and the right boundaries of the signal band. If the signal is symmetric, then \(\Delta\omega_{Lo}=\Delta\omega_{BP}/2\). Outside the band it is valid that \(S(\omega)=0\).

When this signal is sampled with the frequency of \(\omega_{S}=2\pi/g_{S}\), the new discrete signal appears with the spectrum

\[S_{D}(\omega)=\frac{1}{T_{S}}\sum_{r\rightarrow\infty}^{\infty}S(\omega-r \omega_{S}). \tag{1}\]

When sampling the analog signal, the frequency axis is

divided into segments \(\left[k\omega_{5}\,/\,2,\left(k+1\right)\omega_{5}\,/\,2\right]\), where \(k\) is an integer value. If the spectral band of the original signal \(s(t)\) falls inside one of these segments, there is no overlap of the spectra in (1). If for a given \(\omega_{5}\) there exists an integer \(k\geq 0\) satisfying the condition

\[\frac{2(\omega_{sp}-\Delta\omega_{5})}{k}<\omega_{5}<\frac{2(\omega_{sp}+ \Delta\omega_{6})}{k+1} \tag{2}\]

that the value of \(\omega_{5}\) can be used to sample the narrowband signal \(s(t)\). Otherwise, the sampling with a frequency of \(\omega_{5}\) is prohibited.

### _Sample Rate Conversion_

As a result of the sampling of the original bandpass signal with the frequency of \(\omega_{5}\) the sequence of samples \(\left\{s(n)\right\}_{s=0}^{N_{0}-1}\) of finite length \(N_{0}\) is obtained, where \(s(n)=s(nT_{S})\). If the sampling frequency satisfies (2), the bandpass signal can be reconstructed from this sequence in postprocessing inside any segment of the frequency axis \(\left[m\,\omega_{5}\,/\,2,\,\left(m+1\right)\omega_{5}\,/\,2\right]\) with the number \(m>0\). This requires two ideal low-pass filters. One filter (outer) with the frequency response \(H_{OTR}(\omega)\) selects the band \(\left[-(m+1)\omega_{5}\,/\,2,\,\left(m+1\right)\omega_{5}\,/\,2\right]\) that covers the portion of the signal spectrum \(S_{D}(\omega)\) selected for restoration. The impulse response of this filter is

\[h_{OTR}(t)=\left(m+1\right)\,\mathrm{sinc}\left(0.5\,\left(m+1\right)\,\omega _{5}t\right).\]

Another filter (inner) with the frequency response \(H_{INR}(\omega)\) selects the band \(\left[-m\omega_{5}\,/\,2,\,m\omega_{5}\,/\,2\right]\) lying below the restored portion of the spectrum. The impulse response of this filter is

\[h_{INR}(t)=m\,\mathrm{sinc}\left(0.5\,m\,\,\omega_{5}t\right).\]

The relative positions of the signal spectrum and the filters bandwidths are shown in Fig. 4.

The value of the restored signal at time \(t\) is calculated as the difference between the outputs of these filters

\[r(t)=\sum_{n=0}^{N_{0}-1}s(n)\left(h_{OTR}\left(t-nT_{S}\right)-h_{INR}\left( t-nT_{S}\right)\right).\]

Calculations of the values \(r(t)\) can be performed with any sampling period \(T_{U}\) of the restored signal that satisfies the conditions \(T_{U}\ll T_{S}\) and

\[T_{U}<2\pi\,/\left((m+1)\omega_{5}\,\right). \tag{3}\]

As a result of the reconstruction, the new sequence of samples \(\left\{r(n)\right\}_{s=0}^{N_{0}-1}\) of length \(N_{U}=\mathrm{floor}(N_{0}T_{S}\,/\,T_{U})\gg N_{0}\) is obtained, where \(r(n)=r(nT_{U})\).

## IV Calculating the Interval Detween Pulses

Let us denote the original signals sampled at the outputs of the start and stop channels as \(\left\{s_{STR}(n)\right\}_{s=0}^{N_{0}-1}\) and \(\left\{s_{STT}(n)\right\}_{s=0}^{N_{0}-1}\). The values \(s_{STR}(n)\) and \(s_{STT}(n)\) are obtained within a common time window at the same sampling instant with the sequence number \(n=0\ldots N_{0}-1\). Before the further processing, the constant component should be removed from both signals and these signals should be normalized to unit energy

\[\left\langle s_{X}\right\rangle=\frac{1}{N_{O}}\sum_{n=0}^{N_{0}-1}s_{X}(n),\]

\[s_{X}^{\mathrm{nom}}(n)=\frac{s_{X}(n)-\left\langle s_{X}\right\rangle}{ \left(\sum_{i=0}^{N_{0}-1}(s_{X}(k)-\left\langle s_{X}\right\rangle)^{2} \right)^{1/2}},\]

where \(X=\mathit{STR}\), \(\mathit{STP}\). The initial size of the signals is \(N_{O}=107\). The images of the normalized responses of the SAW filters are shown in Fig. 5.

The upsampling is performed in the signals \(\left\{s_{STR}^{\mathrm{nom}}(n)\right\}_{s=0}^{N_{0}-1}\) and \(\left\{s_{STT}^{\mathrm{nom}}(n)\right\}_{s=0}^{N_{0}-1}\) for the selected number \(m\) of the spectral band. The new period of the signal sampling is selected from the condition (3). The result are two new discrete signals \(\left\{u_{STR}(n)\right\}_{s=0}^{N_{0}-1}\) and \(\left\{u_{STT}(n)\right\}_{s=0}^{N_{0}-1}\). The following upsampling parameters \(m=19\)

\(T_{U}=2\pi/\left(100\,(m+1)\omega_{5}\right)\approx 18.8\) ps are selected for this paper. For such parameters, the spectral band limits are [252.7 MHz, 266 MHz] and the upsampled signal length is \(N_{U}=212000\). The upsampled response plots are shown on Fig.5.

The simplest way to calculate the cross-correlation between two discrete signals with the same length is to use the DFT. To do this, each of the signals \(\{u_{SIR}(n)\}_{s=0}^{2N_{U}-1}\) and \(\{u_{SIR}(n)\}_{s=0}^{N_{U}-1}\) is padded with \(N_{U}\) zeros on the left. For padded signals, the DFTs are calculated as the arrays \(\{R_{SIR}^{padd}(n)\}_{s=0}^{2N_{U}-1}\) ii \(\{R_{SIR}^{padd}(n)\}_{s=0}^{2N_{U}-1}\). Now we can calculate the DFT of the cross-correlation function of these two signals as

\[K(n)=-R_{SIP}^{padd}(n)\left(R_{SIR}^{padd}(n)\right)^{*}.\]

The cross-correlation \(\{\hat{k}(n)\}_{s=0}^{2N_{U}-1}\) is calculated from the \(\{K(n)\}_{s=0}^{2N_{U}-1}\) by the inverse DFT usage.

The CCF of two responses of SAW filters of the same type contains oscillations at the central frequency of the spectral band of the reconstructed signal. Therefore, finding the maximum of the CCF is performed not by the CCF itself, but by its amplitude envelope. The envelope of the CCF is calculated through the discrete Hilbert transform. To do this, the DFT \(G(n)\) of the analytical signal is constructed from the original DFT \(K(n)\) as

\[G(n)= \begin{cases}2K(n),0\leq n\leq N_{U},\\ 0,N_{U}<n\leq 2N_{U}-1.\end{cases}\]

The complex-valued analytical signal \(\{\hat{g}(n)\}_{s=0}^{2N_{U}-1}\) is calculated by the inverse transformation from the DFT \(\{G(n)\}_{s=0}^{2N_{U}-1}\). The module of the analytical signal \(\{\hat{g}(n)\}_{s=0}^{2N_{U}-1}\) is the envelope of the CCF

\[\hat{a}(n)= \sqrt{\hat{g}^{*}(n)\hat{g}(n)}\,,\,\,n=0...2N_{U}-1.\]

The DFT algorithm interprets \(2N_{U}\) samples of the signal in the time domain not as the signal of finite duration, but as the realisation of one period of the periodic signal of infinite duration. Therefore, for a visual representation of the results of the inverse DFT, the sequences \(\{\hat{a}(n)\}_{s=0}^{2N_{U}-1}\) and \(\{\hat{k}(n)\}_{s=0}^{2N_{U}-1}\) should be shifted to the right along the time axis by the half of their length. For \(\{\hat{a}(n)\}_{s=0}^{2N_{U}-1}\) this shift is written in the form

\[a(n)= \begin{cases}\hat{a}(N_{U}+n),\,\,0\leq n<N_{U};\\ \hat{a}(n-N_{U}),\,N_{U}\leq n<2N_{U}.\end{cases}\]

The sequence \(\{k(n)\}_{s=0}^{2N_{U}-1}\) is obtained from \(\{\hat{k}(n)\}_{s=0}^{2N_{U}-1}\) after the same shift.

After the shift, the zero value of the interval \(\Delta t\) between the initial and final pulses corresponds to the CCF sample with the number \(N_{U}\) when numbering the samples \(n=0...2N_{U}-1\). The view of the CCF and the envelope with the shift for the signals in Fig. 5 is shown in Fig. 6.

The maximum CCF between the responses of the SAW filters is the maximum of the envelope. The values near the maximum of the CCF which are calculated between two real signals contain random errors arising from random noise in these signals. Smoothing of these errors can be performed by the polynomial interpolation of the CCF near the maximum.

To do this, first it is required to find the sample number containing the maximum of the unsmoothed CCF envelope in the sequence of samples \(\{a(n)\}_{s=0}^{2N_{U}-1}\) : \(n^{\max}=\arg\max\{a(n)\}\). Then, on both sides of this maximum, \(M\) samples of the unsmoothed CCF are selected to create the new sequence of samples \(\{b(m)\}_{s=0}^{2N_{U}-1}\) of odd length \(2M+1\): \(b(m)=a(n^{\max}-M+m)\), \(m\)=\(0...2M-1\). The maximum in this sequence is located in the sample with the number \(m^{\max}=M\) when numbering the counts \(m=0...2M\).

The sequence \(\{b(m)\}_{s=0}^{2M}\) is approximated by a polynomial of even degree of the real argument \(\tilde{m}\in\mathbb{R}\), for example, the second degree:

\[p(\tilde{m})=c_{2}\tilde{m}^{2}+c_{1}\tilde{m}+c_{0}\,.\]

The argument of the polynomial of the second degree, at which it reaches its extreme value, is found according to the well-known expression

\[\tilde{m}^{\max}=-c_{1}\left(2c_{2}\right).\]

The measured value of the time interval between these pulses is the shift value corresponding to the position of the smoothed CCF maximum

\[\Delta t^{\mathrm{poly}}=T_{U}\left(n^{\max}-N_{U}-\left(M-\tilde{m}^{\max} \right)\right).\]

If the polynomial approximation of the maximum is not used, the value of the time interval is calculated from the position of the maximum of the CCF

\[\Delta t^{\mathrm{direct}}=T_{U}\left(n^{\max}-N_{U}\right).\]

Plots of errors in determining the time interval \(\Delta t^{\mathrm{poly}}-\Delta\tilde{t}\), \(\Delta t^{\mathrm{direct}}-\Delta\tilde{t}\) and the difference in the measured values of the shift \(\Delta t^{\mathrm{direct}}-\Delta t^{\mathrm{poly}}\), where \(\Delta\tilde{t}\) is the true value of the interval, are shown in Fig. 7.

It can be seen from these plots that with the selected upsampling parameters, the time interval is measured with

Fig.6: Cross correlation between two upsampled SAW responses with the time interval \(\Delta t^{\mathrm{-1}}-2\).

the systematic error of the order of 2 ns. The origin of this error is most likely related to the round-off errors in the floating-point presentation of numbers. The time resolution of the CCF with these parameters is quite high (\(T_{U}\)\(\,\stackrel{{\sim}}{{{}_{\sim}}}\) 18 ps) and in the absence of measurement noise, the polynomial refinement of the maximum can be neglected

## V Conclusion

This paper confirms the technical possibility of measuring the time interval using the correlation comparison of the responses of the SAW filters. The results of the described algorithms are demonstrated on the single record of the impulse response of the SAW filter, which has been taken as the starting pulse. The SAW filter response corresponding to the stop pulse has been calculated from this record by interpolating (using _sinc_-functions) on the required offset time. The upsampling parameters were chosen without any justification in order to obtain a high-frequency signal with a sufficiently high time resolution.

With such parameters of the algorithm, by calculation, a systematic error of a single measurement of the time interval of the order of 2 ns has been obtained. The origin of this error is most likely related to the round-off errors in the floating-point presentation of numbers. This error was obtained under ideal conditions, i.e. with the complete identity and linearity of the measuring channels, in which there is no measurement noise. Obviously, the next step in the study of the considered approach to the TDC design should be the development of an error model for the correlation comparison of the impulse responses of the SAW filters.
