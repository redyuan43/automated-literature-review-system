Power, Spectrum and Polarization Behaviour of SQW Superluminescent Slodes.

Superluminescent diodes (SLDs) that combine high brightness of LD and wide spectrum (low coherence) of LED having low intensity noise independent on back reflections and high optical fibre coupling efficiency are widely used for optical sensors and communication systems. The advantage of traditional SLD based on bulk heterostructure is a weak dependence of its spectral linewidth (typically \(\Delta\lambda\) = 20nm at \(\lambda\) = 820nm, the corresponding coherence length \(\mathrm{L_{C}}\) = \(\lambda^{2}\)/\(\Delta\lambda\) \(\sim\) 35um) and polarization degree on injection current (output power). For such applications as low coherence reflectometry and white-light interferometry [1] the value of \(\Delta\lambda\) as well as the shape of coherence function (relative visibility) are the main characteristics. Due to simultaneous transitions between different subbands in QW SLD it is possible to obtain \(\Delta\lambda\) several times higher than that of bulk SLD. But due to more complicated band structure its spectrum shape and polarization degree depend significantly on pumping level and need optimization.

Experimental SLD samples were fabricated using MOCVD-grown separate confinement (AlGa)As heterostructure with 0.2um waveguide and 8nm-thick undoped GaAs active layer [2]. The lateral confinement was provided by 4um-wide etched mesa ridge. To suppress optical feedback tandem-type structure with grounded absorber [3] and bent-waveguide structure with an angle 830 with respect to output facet [4] were used.

The theoretical model based on the multisubband effective mass method ( k \(\times\) p - method) was used to describe the active layer band structure. To take into account the valence subband mixture between heavy-holes and light-holes subbands the 4 \(\times\)4 Luttinger-Kohn Hamiltonian was considered [5]. For the conduction band a simple parabolic band model was analyzed. On the basis of the calculated band structure spontaneous emission spectra as well as optical gain spectra for TE and TM polarization modes were obtained for subband-to-subband transitions with carrier concentration as a parameter. Amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) spectra were received from the steady-state solution of one-dimensional rate equations for carrier and photon densities (Fig.1). At high enough carrier densities these spectra contain two pronounced peaks (n = 1,2) due to the existence of two electron subbands in QW.

The typical evolution of 700um-length SQW SLD spectrum is presented on Fig.2. CW light-current characteristics at different temperatures and polarization degree (\(\mathrm{PT_{E}}\) - \(\mathrm{PT_{TM}}\))/(\(\mathrm{PT_{TE}}\) + \(\mathrm{PT_{TM}}\)) versus injection current are shown on Fig.3. These results are in good agreement with calculated ones. At small pumping levels a single spectral peak at \(\lambda\) = 820nm (n=1) is observed. With the increase of current and carrier density second peak at \(\lambda\) = 780nm (n=2) appears, grows and becomes dominant. At low and high currents spectral FWHM is about 20nm like that of bulk SLD. But at intermediate currents I = 110 - 130mA the spectrum is practically symmetric with the flat top and FWHM \(\sim\) 60nm. With some changes of characteristic injection currents these tendencies are also typical for longer and shorter SQW SLDs. An additional possibility of spectrum control is the "combined" (superposition of direct and pulse currents) injection [6]. Polarization degree increases with current stronger than it is predicted by theory. It may be due to higher TM mode losses [3].


Conclusions: The optimization of the device structure and operation mode permits to realize the advantages of SQW SLD for low-coherence applications.
