## I Introduction

High-k/metal gate-stacks are expected to be widely used in sub-28-nm CMOS manufacturing due to the severe limitations of the traditional polysilicon/oxynnitride gate-stack. Although significant process improvements have been made, a basic challenge still lies in the inherently high density of the as-grown oxide defects that lead to threshold voltage instability when charged during operation [1, 2, 3, 4]. To characterize the effect of charge trapping/detrapping at oxide defects, fast measurement techniques such as the pulsed current-voltage [5, 6, 7] and capacitance-voltage (\(C\!-\!V\)) [8, 9] have been recently developed.

In the course of our study on the TiN/HfO\({}_{2}\) gate-stack using the pulsed \(C\!-\!V\) method [8, 9], we came upon a capacitance hysteresis effect that could not be explained in terms of oxide charge trapping/detrapping. Relative positions of the \(C\!-\!V\) curves derived from bidirectional fast voltage-ramp are found to be opposite to those obtained using the quasi-static voltage-sweep method [1]. This means that the two sets of \(C\!-\!V\) data could not be reconciled based on the same oxide charge trapping explanation. The lack of any role of oxide charge trapping is also manifested by the fact that the hysteresis is independent of the voltage-pulse width (which equals the time allowed for charge trapping/detrapping to take place). On the other hand, the hysteresis is found to vary sensitively with the voltage-ramp rate--a larger hysteresis is observed under a faster voltage ramp. This result suggests that the hysteresis is a transient effect arising from a delayed system response to a fast-changing voltage input. An explanation based on interface dipole relaxation is shown to be able to describe most features of the experimental results.

## II Experimental Details

P-type Si MOS capacitors with different gate dielectrics were fabricated. Capacitor A has a 3.2-nm SiO\({}_{2}\), grown by rapid thermal oxidation. Capacitor B has a 4.1-nm HfO\({}_{2}\), formed directly on the Si substrate via atomic layer deposition. Capacitors C and D each has a bi-layer dielectric stack. In the former, the dielectric stack comprises a 1-nm Al\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) on top of a 4.1-nm HfO\({}_{2}\). In the latter, the dielectric stack is made up of a 4.1-nm HfO\({}_{2}\) on top of a 1-nm Al\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\). After gate dielectric deposition, all samples received a 600 \({}^{\circ}\)C annealing for 30 s in nitrogen. The samples were then capped with a TiN gate electrode before receiving a forming gas anneal at 425 \({}^{\circ}\)C for 30 min. P-type MOS capacitors with a thicker HfO\({}_{2}\) and \(n\)-type capacitors with a 3-nm HfO\({}_{2}\) on top of a 1.5-nm SiO\({}_{2}\) (intentionally grown prior to the HfO\({}_{2}\) deposition) were also fabricated and measured.

High-frequency (HF) \(C\!-\!V\) measurement was performed via the CVU module in a Keithley SCS4200 semiconductor characterization system. The frequency of the small signal was 1 MHz and the small-signal amplitude was 50 mV. The measured \(C\!-\!V\) curves were corrected for the substrate series resistance effect [10]. The pulse \(C\!-\!V\) method was implemented via the Agilent B1530A WGFMU module in a B1500A-semiconductor device analyzer. Trapezoidal gate voltage (\(V_{g}\)) pulses of varying widths and transition times (\(t_{r}\)s) were realized with the arbitrary waveform generator. The default \(t_{r}\) was 20 \(\mu\)s, unless stated otherwise. Displacement current \(i_{c}\) at the pulse transition edge was measured using the WGFMU. The MOS capacitance \(C_{g}\) is determined as follows:

\[C_{g}=-i_{c}\cdot\left(\frac{dV_{g}}{dt}\right)^{-1} \tag{1}\]

where \(dV_{g}/dt\) is gate-voltage ramp rate. Fig. 1 shows an example of a series of trapezoidal \(V_{g}\) pulses of varying widths and the corresponding \(i_{c}\) measured at the transition edges. The pulsed \(C\!-\!V\) curves presented later are each the average of ten test devices. All measurements were made at 300 K.

The equivalent oxide thickness (EOT), flat band voltage \(V_{\rm fb}\), and the mid-gap interface-state density \(D_{\rm it}\) of capacitors A-D are summarized in Table I. The former two were extracted from the HF \(C\!-\!V\) curve, by a quantum-mechanical \(C\!-\!V\) simulator [11]. The mid-gap \(D_{\rm it}\) was obtained via the conductance method [10].

## III \(C\!-\!V\) Measurement Results

Fig. 2(a) and (b) depict the HF \(C\!-\!V\) curves of capacitors A and B, respectively. A hysteresis can be observed between the forward (\(V_{\rm low}=-1\) V \(\to V_{\rm hi}=+1\) V; curve \(F\)) and reverse (\(V_{\rm hi}=+1\) V \(\to V_{\rm low}=-1\) V; curve \(R\)) \(C\!-\!V\) curves (inset 1 and 2). It should be noted that curve \(F\) is constantly situated to the left of curve \(R\), i.e. the former always has a more negative \(V_{\rm fb}\). When the \(p\)-Si is biased in accumulation, holes are captured by the oxide traps, charging them up positively. As a consequence, curve \(F\) registers a more negative \(V_{\rm fb}\) during the forward sweep. On the other hand, electrons are captured by the oxide traps when the \(p\)-Si is biased in inversion. Thus, curve \(R\) registers a more positive \(V_{\rm fb}\) during the reverse sweep. The same results are obtained by beginning the measurement at \(V_{g}=V_{\rm hi}=1\) V and sweeping toward \(V_{\rm low}=-1\) V and then back to \(V_{\rm hi}=1\) V (not shown). When the duration for which the device is biased in accumulation or inversion is lengthened (by decreasing the \(V_{g}\) step size), a larger relative shift between curves \(F\) and \(R\) is observed (inset 3). This observation is consistent with the role of oxide charge trapping. A longer time in the accumulation or inversion regime enables a greater number of oxide traps to be charged up, thus resulting in a larger hysteresis.

Fig. 3(a) and (b) show the pulsed \(C\!-\!V\) curves of capacitors A and B, respectively. A few salient differences as compared to Fig. 2(a) and (b) should be highlighted.1 The part of curve \(R\) near \(V_{\rm fb}\) is negatively shifted with respect to curve \(F\). The relative shift between curves \(F\) and \(R\) (i.e. the hysteresis) is unaffected by a wide variation (five orders of magnitude) of the pulse width. Similar observations apply to capacitors C and D, shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b), respectively, as well as to an \(n\)-Si capacitor (with a HfO\({}_{2}\)/SiO\({}_{2}\) gate-stack) shown in Fig. 5(a).

Footnote 1: Another salient feature is the “capacitance hump” in curve \(R\). A similar observation is reported in [8] and [9]. When the capacitor is switched rapidly from inversion to accumulation, the \(p\!-\!n\) junction formed between the channel and substrate is forward biased. The injection and subsequent recombination of the channel carriers with majority carriers in the substrate produce an additional current superimposed on the displacement current, distorting the \(C\!-\!V\) curve near the weak inversion regime. As this paper is not focused on this feature, it will not be discussed further.

These features of the pulsed \(C\!-\!V\) curves are unlike those of the HF \(C\!-\!V\) curves [Fig. 2(a) and (b)], where curve \(R\) is

quasi-static case. This \(V_{\rm{fb}}\) shift or \(\delta V^{\prime}_{\rm{fb}}\) is given by \(Q\cdot(d^{\prime}-d_{0})/\epsilon\), where \(Q\) is dipole charge per unit area, \(\epsilon\) is permittivity of the HfO\({}_{2}\)/SiO\({}_{x}\) interface region, and \(d_{0}\) (\(<d^{\prime}\)) is equilibrium dipole spacing at \(V^{\ast}_{\rm{fb}}\). On the other hand, the dipole spacing is reduced to \(d^{\prime\prime}\) under a positive \(V_{g}\) (+1 V). Similarly, if \(V_{g}\) is now swept rapidly toward the negative regime to the same value of \(V^{\ast}_{g}\), the dipole spacing may remain at \(\sim\)\(d^{\prime\prime}\) (\(<d_{0}\)) due to the lag in dipole response. As a result, the \(V_{\rm{fb}}\) of curve \(R\) would be shifted negatively with respect to that of the quasi-static case, i.e. \(\delta V^{\prime\prime}_{\rm{fb}}=Q\cdot(d^{\prime\prime}-d_{0})/\epsilon\). The total hysteresis is thus given by \(\Delta V_{\rm{fb}}=Q\cdot(d^{\prime}-d^{\prime\prime})/\epsilon\propto Q\cdot \Delta d\).

In the above discussion, we have assumed that the dipole moment is directed toward the gate. It should be mentioned that the orientation of the dipole does not affect the relative positions of curves \(F\) and R, although it has an impact on the exact value of \(V_{\rm{fb}}\). If the dipole moment in Fig. 7 is reversed, the same relative shift of the two curves would also be observed. In this case, even though the dipole spacing \(d^{\prime}<d_{0}\) under a negative \(V_{g}\), the reduced spacing would result in the positive and being situated further from and the negative end closer to the Si substrate. Therefore, curve \(F\) would still exhibit a positive \(V_{\rm{fb}}\) shift relative to the quasi-static case. Conversely, \(V_{\rm{fb}}\) would be shifted negatively under the reverse \(V_{g}\) ramp. This explains the pulsed \(C-V\) hysteresis result of capacitor A with a SiO\({}_{2}\) gate oxide [Fig. 3(a)]. Although the dipole moment at the SiO\({}_{2}\)/Si interface is opposite to that of the HfO\({}_{2}\)/Si interface [19, 20], the same relative shift between curves \(F\) and \(R\) is observed.

An approximate analytical expression for \(\Delta V_{\rm{fb}}\) in terms of the rigidity of the interface dipole and the voltage ramp rate may be obtained by considering the "ball and spring" representation shown in Fig. 8. The balls denote atoms which form the positive and negative ends of the interface dipole. Electrostatic interaction between the positive and negative poles is represented by the spring. When the distance between the two poles is larger than the equilibrium separation \(d_{0}\), the spring exerts an attractive (restoring) force \(F_{s}\) which attempt to bring the two poles closer to one another [Fig. 8(a)]. Conversely, the spring exerts a repulsive force \(F_{s}\) that tends to bring the two poles further apart when the interspacing is less than \(d_{0}\) [Fig. 8(b)]. For simplicity, the negative pole is assumed to be fixed and only the positive pole moves in response to the applied \(V_{g}\) ramp. The electrostatic force exerted by the applied oxide field may be expressed as

\[F_{e}=E_{\rm{ox}}\cdot q_{d}=-\left(\frac{V_{g}0\pm s\cdot t}{T_{\rm{ox}}} \right)\cdot q_{d} \tag{2}\]

where \(E_{\rm{ox}}\) is oxide field, \(q_{d}\) is dipole charge, \(V_{g0}\) is gate voltage prior to the start of the ramp, \(s\) is ramp rate, \(t\) is time after the start of the ramp, and \(T_{\rm{ox}}\) is gate oxide thickness. The "+" ("--") sign applies for the positive (negative) ramp. The restoring force \(F_{s}\) on the positive pole, due to displacement \(x\) from the equilibrium separation \(d_{0}\), may be expressed using Hooke's law as

\[F_{s}=-k\cdot x \tag{3}\]

where \(k\) is a spring constant--a measure of the elasticity of the chemical bond between the positive and negative poles. As the dipole respond to the changing oxide field, it also experiences a "frictional" force (exerted by surrounding atoms) which may be expressed as

\[F_{c}=-c\cdot\frac{dx}{dt} \tag{4}\]

where \(c\) is a constant denoting the viscosity of the local oxide network. Considering the net force (\(F_{e}+F_{s}+F_{c}\)) and applying Newton's second law on the positive end of the dipole of mass \(m\) yields a second-order time differential equation in \(x\) whose solution is of the form

\[x = A\cdot e^{-\frac{c_{d}}{2m}}\cdot\sin\left(t\cdot\sqrt{\frac{k}{ m}\left(1-\frac{c^{2}}{4k\cdot m}\right)}+\phi\right) \tag{5}\] \[- \frac{q_{d}\cdot V_{g}}{k\cdot T_{\rm{ox}}}\pm\frac{c\cdot q_{d} \cdot s}{k^{2}\cdot T_{\rm{ox}}}\]

where \(V_{g}=V_{g0}\pm s\cdot t\). The sine term describes damped harmonic oscillation with a phase offset \(\phi\); the second term gives the equilibrium position under a given \(V_{g}\), and the third term denotes the displacement lag.

For a given \(V_{g}\), if one assumes that the phase of the damped oscillation under forward sweep is \(\varphi\), the corresponding phase under reverse sweep may be expressed as \(2\pi-\varphi\). The respective time \(t_{f}\) and \(t_{r}\) needed to reach a given \(V_{g}\) under the forward (\(V_{g0}=-1\) V) and the reverse (\(V_{g0}=1\) V) sweep are \((1+V_{g})/s\) and \((1-V_{g})/s\). The corresponding displacement \(x_{f}\) and \(x_{r}\) are given by

\[x_{f} = A\cdot e^{-\frac{c_{df}}{2m}}\cdot\sin\varphi-\frac{q_{d}\cdot V _{g}}{k\cdot T_{\rm{ox}}}+\frac{c\cdot q_{d}\cdot s}{k^{2}\cdot T_{\rm{ox}}} \tag{6a}\] \[x_{r} = A\cdot e^{-\frac{c_{df}}{2m}}\cdot\sin\left(2\pi-\varphi\right)- \frac{q_{d}\cdot V_{g}}{k\cdot T_{\rm{ox}}}-\frac{c\cdot q_{d}\cdot s}{k^{2} \cdot T_{\rm{ox}}}. \tag{6b}\]

The difference in the displacement of the positive pole under the forward and reverse sweeps at the given \(V_{g}\) is then given by

\[\Delta d = A\cdot e^{-\frac{c}{2m}s}\cdot\left(e^{-\frac{cV_{g}}{2m}+s}+e ^{\frac{cV_{g}}{2m}}\right)\cdot\sin\varphi+\frac{2c\cdot q_{d}\cdot s}{k^{2} \cdot T_{\rm{ox}}} \tag{7}\] \[\geq 2A\cdot e^{-\frac{c}{2m}s}\sin\varphi+\frac{2c\cdot q_{d}\cdot s} {k^{2}\cdot T_{\rm{ox}}}\]

noting that \(\exp[-c\cdot V_{g}/(2m\cdot s)]+\exp[c\cdot V_{g}/(2m\cdot s)]\geq 2\).

Also shown are the electrostatic force (\(F_{e}\)) due to the applied oxide field, the restoring force (\(F_{s}\)) on the dipole due to displacement from the equilibrium position (\(x=d_{0}\)), and the “frictional” force (\(F_{e}\)) arising from the “viscosity” of the surrounding network. (a) The lag in dipole response when \(V_{g}\) is ramped from \(-1\) V to 1 V. (b) The corresponding lag under a reverse voltage ramp (i.e. 1 V to -1 V). Conversely, the spring exerts a repulsive force \(F_{s}\) that tends to bring the two poles further apart when the interspacing is less than \(d_{0}\) [Fig. 8(b)]. For simplicity, the negative pole is assumed to be fixed and only the positive pole moves in response to the applied \(V_{g}\) ramp. The electrostatic force exerted by the applied oxide field may be expressed as Though simple, (7) succinctly captures the dependence of \(\Delta d\) on \(c\), \(s\), \(k\), and \(T_{\text{ox}}\). A larger \(c\) (i.e. higher viscosity of the local oxide network) and a smaller \(k\) (i.e. the dipole is more elastic) both increase the displacement lag under a given ramp rate. Equation (7) also predicts that for a given gate dielectric and ramp rate, \(\Delta d\) (and hence the capacitance hysteresis) decreases with increase in the dielectric thickness \(T_{\text{ox}}\). Increasing \(T_{\text{ox}}\) reduces the oxide field for a given \(V_{g}\) and thus the displacement lag. This is validated in Fig. 9, which shows that the relative shift between curves \(F\) and \(R\) is reduced for a capacitor (E) with a thicker \(\text{HO}_{2}\) gate dielectric (EOT = 3.7 nm) fabricated at the same time as capacitor B. The ratio of the hysteresis of capacitor B to capacitor E is 1.6 (\(\approx\)153/95), which is in good agreement with the ratio of the respective EOTs (3.7/2.4).

It should be mentioned that a lag in interface dipole response should in principle also exist during HF \(C-V\) measurement, due to the rapidly changing ac signal. However, the hysteresis in the forward and reverse HF \(C-V\) curves is due mainly to oxide charge trapping and not the interface dipole relaxation effect. Since the amplitude of the ac signal is typically very small (\(\sim\)50 mV), we believe that the lag is much lesser than that for the pulsed \(C-V\) measurement, during which a significant change in \(V_{g}\) (\(\sim\)1 V) occurs over a short time interval (\(\sim\mu\)s). Moreover, the capacitance obtained from the HF \(C-V\) method is an average value derived over many ac cycles. Averaging would further suppress the transient hysteresis effect. On the other hand, real-time measurement is made under the pulsed \(C-V\) method and any transient hysteresis effect can be observed clearly.

## V Conclusion

We observed, from pulsed \(C-V\) measurement on the high-k/TIN gate MOS capacitor, a capacitance hysteresis which could not be explained in terms of charge trapping/detrapping in the gate dielectric. First, relative positions of the \(C-V\) curves and the associated \(V_{\text{th}}\) shifts derived from bidirectional fast voltage sweeps were opposite to those obtained from the quasi-static sweep method. Second, the hysteresis is found to be independent of a five order-of-magnitude variation in the pulse width. On the other hand, the hysteresis was observed to depend sensitively on the voltage ramp rate, which implies that it arises out of a lag in the dielectric response to the fast changing oxide field. An interface dipole relaxation model that could explain the dependence of the hysteresis on the ramp rate, viscosity of the local oxide network, elasticity of the dipole as well as the thickness of the dielectric was proposed. As verified experimentally, the model showed that the hysteresis would be more severe when the thickness of a given gate-stack is decreased. The model also suggested possible mitigation of the hysteresis effect through a reduction of the factor \((c\cdot q_{d})/k^{2}\) via process optimization. Since having a certain dipole density may be crucial for threshold voltage tuning, understanding how the elasticity of the dipoles could be controlled (so as to effectively suppress the hysteresis effect) needs to be further investigated.
