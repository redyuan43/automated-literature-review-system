## I Introduction

Exelible organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays are self-emitting devices with many attractive features such as being paper thin, lightweight, bendable, and unbreakable. These advantages are not achievable in conventional liquid crystal displays using glass substrates. The development of thin-film transistors (TFTs) based on low temperature poly-silicon and oxide semiconductors has accelerated the development of TFT array backplanes for flexible OLEDs by facilitating their fabrication on existing display production lines [1, 2, 3]. Meanwhile, the low-temperature (below 200 \({}^{\circ}\)C) processability of organic semiconductors has enabled the development of organic TFTs (OTFTs) on plastic substrates [4, 5, 6]. Since the organic semiconductors (OSCs) are solution processable, OTFTs can be fabricated with low-cost, large-area, and more environmentally friendly manufacturing techniques. Therefore, the development of solution-processed OTFT backplanes for flexible OLED displays have been strongly expected as a core technology for future flexible and printable electronics that enables high quality images on a flexible film fabricated with reasonable costs. While a number of studies in the literature have been reported for the preparation of OTFTs using solution processed OSCs, they have hardly been used as integrated drive circuits for flexible OLEDs [7, 8, 9]. Furthermore, existing flexible OLED designs all include single light-emission layers, and do not exploit the higher current efficiency offered by multiphoton emission. This letter describes the preparation and performance of a high-resolution (300 dpi) flexible OLED display in which highly efficient multiphoton OLED pixels are driven by an OTFT backplane.

## II Device Structure and Fabrication

The structure of the flexible OLED display pixels developed here is shown in Fig. 1. The circuit for each pixel consists of a switching transistor (Sw-Tr) for selecting pixel, a drive transistor (Dr-Tr) for supplying current to the OLED, and a storage capacitor (Cs) for maintaining the gate voltage across the drive transistor for the period during one scan frame. Firstly, to facilitate handling during the fabrication process, a 125 \(\mu\)m thick of polyethylene naphthalene (PEN) film was bonded to a glass substrate using a silicone-based adhesive layer (4309; 3M Japan Ltd.). A clean planarization layer (400 nm thick) was formed on the PEN film by spin coating the fluoropolymer EPRIMA AL-X6 (Asahi Glass Co.). The 50 nm thick Al gate electrode layer was prepared by vacuum deposition. The electrodes were patterned using conventional

photolithography and wet etching. For the gate dielectric layer, cardo-polymer (GIP-2001/P2.5K, Nippon Steel & Sumikin Chemical Co., Ltd.) was selected because of the good heat resistance and high transparency [10]. A dielectric layer was formed by spin-coating, baked at 90 \({}^{\circ}\)C to eliminate the residual solvent, and then exposed to UV light (\(\lambda=365\) nm) at 9,000 mJ/cm\({}^{2}\) to induce photo crosslinking. A post-bake was then performed at 150 \({}^{\circ}\)C for 1 h in air ambient, resulting in a 400 nm thick film. Subsequently, Au source/drain (S/D) electrodes, 50 nm thick, were formed by vacuum deposition and patterned using photolithography and wet etching. The semiconducting channel was enclosed in a bank structure to prevent the formation of an OSC layer beyond the S/D region; a highly lyophobic fluoropolymer (Teflon AF1600 DuPont-Mitsui Fluorochemical Co., Ltd.) was spin-coated over the entire surface and then covered with resist. A fluoropolymer surfactant (FC4432; 3M Japan, Ltd.) was added (0.5 wt%) to the resist solution to improve the wettability to Teflon [11], whose high lyophobicity usually prevents its coating with resist materials. After patterning the resist layer as the bank structure by photolithography, the Teflon layer was wet-etched using a fluoropolymer solvent (Fluorinert FC-43; 3M Japan Ltd.), exposing the S/D electrodes and gate dielectric layer therein. The S/D electrodes were then treated with a self-assembled monolayer (Lisicon M001; Merck Ltd.). As shown in Fig. 2, the semiconducting layer (Lisicon S1200; Merck Ltd.) was formed by using the solution-shearing [12], which consumes less semiconducting ink than spin-coating and is faster than ink-jet printing. The OSC solution was dispensed onto the substrate, and the droplet was dispersed by the moving PEN film. The OSC solution was patterned only in the channel region in a self-organized manner since the OSC solution remained on the cardo-polymer while dewetted on the Teflon layer defining the bank walls. For protection and used as an interlayer, Teflon and Cytop (Asahi Glass Co.) layers were subsequently spin-coated onto the OSC layer. A bottom-emission structure was selected for the OEED pixels due to facile fabrication. A 250 nm thick of indium-zinc-oxide transparent anode layer was deposited by RF sputtering. During the fabrication of the OTFT backplane, the anode layer was covered by dielectric polymer, so that the dielectric layer on the anode was removed by dry etching before forming the OEED active layers. Multiphoton-emission OEED pixels consist of two stacked light-emission units [13]. The emission spectrum for the white light emitted contains two peaks, one each at blue and yellow wavelengths. The current efficiency attained, 31 cd/A, is roughly twice that of an OEED with a single light-emission layer.

## III Results and Discussion

Since fine S/D electrodes are desirable for integrated drive circuits, these are typically prepared by photolithography with a bottom-gate/bottom-contact configuration, wherein an appropriate choice of dielectric material is critical to avoid lithographic damage. We investigated the robustness of the cardo-polymer and found it to be highly resistant to photolithography process; the surface remaining very smooth even after patterning the Au S/D electrodes [14]. The root-mean-square roughness (Rq) increased slightly from 0.2 nm for the as-prepared dielectric layer to 0.5 nm after wet etching of the Au layer. These roughness levels are much lower than those of other gate dielectric polymer materials, such as poly(4-vinylphenol) and Teflon (Rq = 1.1 and 1.5 nm, respectively). Patterning in the OSC region is crucial in view of improving the on/off ratio. The OSC layer was therefore isolated by exploiting the difference in wettability to the semiconducting ink of the cardo-polymer layer and Teflon bank. Indeed, the contact angle of mesitylene, the solvent for the OSC layer, was \(66.1^{\circ}\) on the Teflon bank but only \(9.2^{\circ}\) on the cardo-polymer. This enabled us to successfully pattern tens of thousands of active OSC layers. The cross-polarized microscope image in Fig. 3 highlights the crystallinity of the patterned OSC layers obtained using this simple solution-shearing method. A high pixel density of 300 dpi was achieved, with Sw-Tr and Dr-Tr areas of 28 \(\mu\)m x 29 \(\mu\)m and 40 \(\mu\)m x 50 \(\mu\)m, respectively; the OSC layers are 15-20 nm thick. Fig. 4(a) shows the electrical

For curve A, the OSC covered the entire surface of the device; this was gradually trimmed between the S/D electrodes before recording curves B and C.

transfer characteristics measured in saturation at a drain-to-source voltage of \(-20\) V, for OTFT devices with and without OSC patterning. The increase in the on/off current ratio afforded by patterning is clear. The on/off ratio of the unpatterned device is four orders of magnitude lower, which may be because of the leakage current that flows between unpatterned OSC areas. It was confirmed that leakage current was reduced by simply trimming the OSC between the S/D electrodes, as shown in Fig. 4(b), suggesting the occurrence of the same effect as with the patterning of OSC using the bank structure. To achieve a satisfactory low off current, patterning of the channel was required. Finally, the OTFT with the patterned OSC resulted in reduced leakage current and an improved on/off ratio. The field-effect mobility, on/off current ratio, and the threshold voltage (\(V_{th}\)) are \(0.25\) cm\({}^{2}\)/(V \(\cdot\) s), \(1.4\times 10^{7}\), and \(-0.4\) V, respectively, with a \(V_{th}\) close to zero and little hysteresis suggesting a low density of charge trapping sites at the interface of the OSC and gate dielectric layers. This is attributed to the high stability during processing of the cardo-polymer, which suffers little physical or chemical damage during the formation either of the S/D electrodes or of the bank structure. Fig. 5(a) shows that the devices prepared the here are highly uniform in their performance, while Fig. 5(b) shows that the performance varies little with the shearing direction used during fabrication; this is because the bank reduces the shearing force such that the crystal domains grow from the S/D electrodes and the Teflon bank irrespective of the shearing direction. Source and drain electrodes can thereby be placed in different directions on the substrate, as in our backplane design. Solution shearing on a bank structure is therefore a simple process to fabricate many high quality transistors for the OTFT backplane in a single step. The white monochromatic OLED panel was \(3.25\) cm \(\times\)\(3.25\) cm across with \(324\times 128\) pixels, each measuring \(84.7\)\(\mu\)m \(\times\)\(254\)\(\mu\)m, corresponding to a resolution of \(300\) dpi. Photolithography allows an S/D electrode spacing of just \(5\)\(\mu\)m (in both directions). The flexible OLED display and drive circuits were connected via a flexible printed circuit and moving images were successfully displayed, even under bending, as shown in Fig. 6. Modulating the pixel selection voltage and the data voltage of this OLED device allows both still images and video to be displayed. Normal operation was also verified for drive frequencies ranging from \(30\) to \(240\) Hz. A luminance of \(107\) cd/m\({}^{2}\) was obtained with a cathode voltage of \(-23\) V.

## IV Conclusion

A flexible multiphoton OLED display device with a solution-processed OTFT backplane has been prepared by effectively selecting and integrating the components and fabrication techniques. Careful lyophobic/lyophilic processing of the insulating material, the bank structure, and the OSC ensures high performance, even under bending. Work is ongoing to fabricate an entire OTFT backplane, including the metal contacts and interconnect layers, using exclusively solution processes.
