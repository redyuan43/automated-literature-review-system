## 1 Introduction

In semiconductor manufacturing, a wide variety of tuning knobs have been developed to control the processes. The optimization of semiconductor manufacturing process could be a serious issue because of the complex process itself, and also the correlation between each tuning parameters. The difficulty of process development is finding parameter combination to compensate trade-off relations between some objectives. A ML approach has drawn a great attention for matter engineering because it is promising as a powerful tool to optimize these parameters [1-6]. We have applied machine learning techniques such as regression and optimization algorithms to optimize semiconductor manufacturing process. In this study, the ML has been applied to optimize the deposition process condition and the plasma distribution control knob. The plasma distribution is related with the uniformity of film thickness and etch rate within a wafer. These properties are crucially important from the semiconductor manufacturing viewpoints.

## 2 Experimental and Methods

The ML based on a regression algorithm was utilized in this study. Our approach is that build regression models with tuning parameter as explanatory variables and the uniformity of film thickness and etch rate as objective variable. The model generated by regression algorithm does not include physical meanings which is called non-semantic data model. The experimental flow of our modeling system is shown as a following.

1. Build the model by regression algorithm with dataset, initial dataset is given by design of experiment (DOE).

2. Find parameter combinations which achieve condition by inputting target values of objective variables and its models into optimization algorithm.

3. Experiment with parameter combinations given by optimization and compare experiment result to optimized value.

4. Register experiment result as new learning dataset.

Repeat step 1-4 until getting the expected result as showing Fig.1. It enables to start from small data set and improve as data increasing.

Three different processes were optimized; film-thickness nonuniformity of PEALD TiO\({}_{2}\), film stress of PEALD SiO\({}_{2}\) and knob parameter tuning of a separated plasma electrode.

The base process condition of PEALD TiO\({}_{2}\) is shown in the article [7]. Capacitively coupled plasmas (CCPs) were ignited in Ar/O\({}_{2}\) gas mixture with 450 kHz frequency. The input RF power, duration time, four gas flow rates were tuned. Nonuniformity is defined as 1 sigma of thickness at 49 points within a wafer. The target of nonuniformity is close to zero. Process optimization was performed by engineer and appling ML, respectively. As the initial condition, 8 conditions based on DOE inputs for the ML approach. Sample making was repeated five times. Three process conditions were chosen based on the obtained results each time. After repeated five times, the nonuniformity and the degree of convergence of nonuniformity were compared.

The base condition of PEALD SiO\({}_{2}\) is different from TiO\({}_{2}\). However, the tuning parameters of PEALD SiO\({}_{2}\) were same as PEALD TiO\({}_{2}\), RF power, duration time and four gas flow rates were tuned. The other parameters were fixed. CCPs were ignited in Ar/O\({}_{2}\) gas mixture with 450 kHz frequency. Film stress was measured by ellipsometer. The target of film stress was from -100 MPa to zero in this study. An engineer has tried to optimize the film stress by a conventional trial and error approach. The parameters generated in the

nonuniformity optimization by ML were referd for this stress tuning study in order to explore a new process window.

Figure 2 shows the experimental setup of the separated plasma electrode in a capacitively coupled plasmas in Ar/O\({}_{2}\) gas mixture with 13.56 MHz frequency. To control the plasma distribution, the capacitances of a center and an outer (ring) electrodes are tuned respectively. To evaluate the applicability of ML in the process tuning, two experiments were applied: One is the plasma etching process for carbon films; and the other is the plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) process for silicon dioxide films.

For both processes, the profiles of the film thickness were measured at 49 points within the wafer. The input RF power, the pressure, the gas flow rate and the capacitances at the each electrodes were tuned. After the 50 initial etching profile data were learned, the 49 models corresponding to each measuring point were produced by ML. Initial process data, i.e. thickness profiles, was obtained for machine learning based on DOE and a database of the thickness profiles associated with each process condition was prepared. Machine leaning generated 49 models, which correspond to each measuring point, to express the correlation between the thickness profiles and the process conditions. These models provided us the promising process condition in turn to realize a desired thickness profile. The target profiles are flat, edge high and very edge high (see Fig. 5 (a)).

## Results and discussion

### Optimizing film-thickness nonuniformity

The PEALD film-thickness nonuniformity within a wafer was also optimized by an engineer and by ML approach. Figure 3 shows that the engineer could not settle the variation of nonuniformity but the ML could find the optimum condition quickly and settle the variation. The optimized condition of ML is totally different with the optimized condition of an engineer. The new process window has been explored.

### Optimizing film stress

The stress optimization was also conducted by an engineer and also by using ML approach (see Fig. 4). Although the engineer tried to optimize the process condition for 52 times based on his knowledge (\(\blacklozenge\)), the target stress (-100 MPa) could not be achieved. After that, the model was generated by the learned process data. All the three process conditions (\(\bigcirc\)) created by the ML approach met with the target stress. It is also found that the ML approach is very useful to investigate unknown process conditions even when the engineer could not find it.

Parameter splits chosen by an engineer is likely to be biased. This bias narrows the process window. It is a coincidence that the result of nonuniformity of TiO\({}_{2}\) optimized the stress of SiO\({}_{2}\). However, this experiment showed the process conditions already obtained by ML could expand the process window.

### Optimizing knob parameters

Figure 5 shows the results of carbon etching amount, which are defined as the differences in the film thickness before and after the plasma etching with three profile targets. In Fig. 5, (a) shows the predicted profile used learned models and (b) shows the experimental results optimized by ML. The ML models successfully generated the process conditions to realize these etching profiles: The flat, the edge high and the very edge high. It has been found that the experimental results correspond with the ML predictions for three target profiles. However one can see a large difference in the case of very edge high profiles and that of target in the center region. These results are presumably attributed to the initial database; its quality (variation) is not sufficient to generate the model for very edge high profiles via machine learning. The ML results also shows that the O2 flow rate has the greatest contribution to the etching profiles (see Table 1). This tendency suggests that the plasma distribution is sensitive with the O2 flow rate. It was also enable to applied to not only optimization of different characteristic object but also to create edge high shapes by optimizing the regression model for each profile data.

The same ML approach is applied to the PEALD process for silicon dioxide films. As shown in Fig. 6 (a), the thickness profiles by the PEALD were successfully tuned by the ML approach similar to Fig. 5 (b). The ML approach is also applicable to the PEALD process. As described above, the O2 flow rate greatly contributes to the plasma distribution. It is found that this parameter is also applicable to adjusting the thickness profiles for the PEALD process (see Fig. 6 (b)). It is found that the lower O2 flow rate enables to obtain the very edge high profile. We confirmed that adding knowledge based experiment results to input database improves accuracy.

## Conclusion

In summary, the nonuniformity of PEALD film thickness, the PEALD film stress, the carbon etching profile and the PEALD film thickness profile were optimized by ML approach and successfully achieved the targets. Even if the database does not cover the target value, the ML approach is useful because the ML approach allows us to explore a new process window.

In some cases (thickness nonuniformity and stress optimization), the ML approach is found to be more powerful than the knowledgeable engineers. The authors showed the effectiveness of ML approach for the semiconductor manufacturing processes.
