## I Introduction

To establish the IoT society, we have to create many kinds of flexible electronic devices, such as a flexible display, sensor, power source, and connectors. For this, we have been attempting to demonstrate the prototype fabrication of a pressure sensor, proximity sensor, thermoelectric conversion device, and film-type connector by thick-pattern printing techniques. Also, we have developed novel high precision printing techniques, - screen-offset printing technique and adhesion contrast planography-, which must be innovative technologies for electronic device manufacturing in the near future. Furthermore, combination of printed-electronics and MEMS technology, called "flexible hybrid electronics", have been attracted much attention recently to manufacture the flexible electronic devices. In this report, we explain these technologies, creating a new paradigm in the field of electronics.

## II High-Resolution Printing

### _Microcontact Printing Technique_

Microcontact printing is well known as a patterning technique for a self-assembled monolayer [1]. We applied this technique to the formation of fine patterns of non-self-assembled materials (conductive ink, dielectric ink, and organic semiconductor ink), to fabricate the transistor array on a flexible thin film. Fine patterns with a width of 0.5 um was successfully formed by microcontact printing of the silver-nanoparticle-dispersed ink (Fig. 1). The reason why high-resolution patterns can be obtained by microcontact printing is due to the fact that the semi-dried ink is transferred from a PDMS (poly(dimethylsiloxane)) stamp, which absorbs organic solvents contained in the ink, to a substrate [2-4]; after transferring the semi-dried ink from the stamp to the final substrate, spreading of the ink becomes smaller than that of the usual ink, because viscosity of the semi-dried ink becomes significantly high. This feature of the PDMS stamp enables to form fine patterns by the microcontact printing technique.

The reason of high resolution obtained by reverse-offset printing is almost the same as that of the microcontact printing technique. The advantage of reverse-offset printing is uniformity of pattern thickness. Thickness of printed patterns formed by microcontact printing, which uses a relief stamp, depends on the pattern width (Fig. 2). Meanwhile, reverse-offset printing based on contact linking technique can form patterns with a uniform thickness regardless of the width.

### _All Printed Organic Thin Film Transistor Array_

200-pii OTFTs were fabricated by microcontact printing technique. All layers, -gate electrode, gate insulator, source and drain electrodes, and organic semiconductor (poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl)-, were printed onto a polycarbonate film (Fig. 3). Both the minimum pattern width and the distance between the patterns were 5 \(\upmu\)m in this array. The sheet-type bendable liquid crystal display (LCD) was also fabricated by combination of a polymer-network-type liquid crystal and the

developed all-printed OTFT backplane sheets. We successfully demonstrated to display a movie using this LCD sheets.

## III Screen-Offset Printing

It is difficult to form thick patterns by microcontact and reverse-offset printings, in contrast to the fact that screen printing is easy to form thick patterns. Thus, the essential of high-resolution patterning in microcontact printing was applied to the screen printing technique, to develop a novel high-resolution thick patterning method, called screen-offset printing (Fig. 4) [5,6]. This printing makes it possible to form 20-\(\upmu\)m-wide and 3-\(\upmu\)m-thick patterns on a PET (polyethylene trephthalate) film by using commercially available screen masks and conductive pastes. Also, the screen-offset printing can form patterns with a rectangular cross section (Fig. 5). Further, a screen-offset printing machine was manufactured. We do not have to push down a squeeze (Fig. 4), and therefore, the line width in transverse direction was almost the same as that in machine direction (Fig. 6). The print reiteration is 1,000 times without replacement of a screen mask and a PDMS blanket. The uniformity obtained by screen-offset-printed patterns are very important for the fabrication of electronic devices.

## IV Flexible Hybrid Electronics

Printed electronics is a new type of technology, in which electronic systems and components are directly produced on rigid, flexible, or stretchable substrates by coating and printing processes, rather than common photolithographic processes. Many companies' and researchers technological interests are focused in "how to form finer lines". Printing processes to form fine patterns are necessary for fabricating integrated circuits and electronic components such as OTFTs. However, important technology is not only high-resolution patterning. We should also take into account high-uniformity patterning for manufacturing electronic devices, as shown in Fig. 2.

At the same time, a pressure sensor array sheet [7] and a flexible proximity sensor (Fig. 7) [8] were fabricated toward health and welfare services. For example, we are currently attempting to apply the proximity sensors to diagnosis of the sleep apnea syndrome; printed electronics can also be applied to such simple devices.

The high precision printing processes, which can control the uniformities of the pattern width and thickness, surface flatness, and rectangularity of cross section, are required to fabricate TFTs, sensors, interconnection substrates, and passive components. However, logic circuits and memories are too difficult to fabricate by only the printed electronics technologies, even if the high precision printing processes are established. Thus, for the realization of true flexible electronics, we hardly avoid using the hybridisation of small/thin silicon chips produced by MEMS technology and printed electronics technology; to establish this flexible hybrid electronics, the high precision printing method should be established.
