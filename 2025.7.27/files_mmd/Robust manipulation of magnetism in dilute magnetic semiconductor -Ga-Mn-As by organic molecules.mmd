In the case of III-V dilute magnetic semiconductors (DMSs), the holes from Mn doping are known to mediate the ferromagnetic interaction. We firstly demonstrated the organic molecular manipulation of the magnetism of (Ga,Mn)As. Mn-doped GaAs thin films with various thicknesses were grown by low-temperature molecular-beam epitaxy, and organic charge-transfer molecules were deposited on the surface of (Ga,Mn)As films by either solution-based self-assembly or vacuum thermal evaporation, which led to large carrier density modulation, and significant changes in the Curie temperature (Tc) and magnetization (Ms). Electron donor (acceptor) molecules were found to decrease (increase) both Tc and Ms. Moreover, through proper preparation of the (Ga,Mn)As surface, self-assembled monolayer (SAM) patterns of organic molecules with sub-75 nanometer line width were successfully created via dip-pen nanolithography (DPN). These results could open a new pathway to control nano-scale manipulation of magnetism in DMS, with potential applications in reconfigurable, non-volatile and hybrid molecular nano-spintronics.
