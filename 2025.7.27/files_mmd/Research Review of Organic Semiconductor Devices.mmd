## I Introduction

Organic semiconductor materials offer several benefits, including transparency, the ability to form large-area films, low production costs, and flexibility. As a result, organic power semiconductors derived from these materials possess distinct advantages that have garnered significant interest from researchers. Unlike inorganic power semiconductors, the structure of organic materials can be meticulously tailored through chemical design, facilitating performance adjustments and application customization. The production process for organic materials is straightforward and economical, making it well-suited for large-scale manufacturing and the demands for flexible devices. While inorganic materials excel in high-power and high-frequency electronic applications, organic materials are more environmentally friendly and align with sustainable development goals, making them ideal for use in flexible electronics and biomedical applications.

The advancement in devices like organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) and organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs) has been swift, marked by notable improvements in both efficiency and durability. The integration of organic semiconductors with other materials, including the optimization of organic-metal interfaces and the combination of organic and inorganic materials, has introduced innovative approaches to boost device performance.

To address the effects of lateral leakage and understand the underlying mechanisms, a precise model has been proposed that involves simultaneous measurements of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and OTFTs[1]. This research paves the way for evaluating the impact of semiconductor layers and the parallel structure of devices on practical applications for self-luminous arrays.

Organic semiconductors have found positive applications in fields such as flat panel display backplanes and sensor arrays. The transistors that Yuan Y et al.[2] produced have a hole mobility as high as 43cm2V-1s-1, and display a 490% high transparency in the visible light spectrum, indicating their potential for use in transparent, high-performance organic electronic products.

Figure 1: (a) Schematic illustration of charges motion in OLEDs array unit. (b) Actual pictures of OLEDs measurements[1]Flexible OFETs have high extensibility, matching well with the large deformations of human skin, and are an important component of the next generation of wearable electronic devices. Fuming Wu et al.[5] presented the recent research progress on high-mobility stretchable field-effect transistors in recent years, summarizing their different structures and potential applications.

However, the carrier mobility of organic semiconductor materials is low, resulting in slower electron transfer speeds. Their stability and durability are relatively poor, which limits their application in high-performance electronic devices that are resistant to high temperatures and pressures. Therefore, improvements are needed in organic device structures, semiconductor materials, manufacturing processes, and other aspects.

## II The Structure of OFETs

Based on the positions of the gate electrode and organic semiconductor layer, as well as the contact positions of the organic semiconductor layer with the source and drain metal electrodes, there are four common structures of organic power field-effect transistors: top-gate top-contact (TGTC), top-gate bottom-contact (TGBC), bottom-gate top-contact (BGTC), and bottom-gate bottom-contact (BGBC).

Figure 4 shows the schematic diagram of TGTC. When a gate-source voltage (\(V_{\text{gs}}\)) is applied to the gate, induced charges are generated at the interface between the semiconductor layer and the gate dielectric layer. \(V_{\text{gs}}\) should be higher than the threshold voltage (\(V_{\text{T}}\)) of the semiconductor, so that the induced charges can flow freely, forming a conductive channel. Additionally, the voltage difference between the drain and source electrodes (\(V_{\text{dh}}\)) causes the carriers to transfer between the source and drain electrodes, forming a source-drain current (\(I_{\text{dh}}\)). As \(V_{\text{dh}}\) increases, \(I_{\text{dh}}\) also increases, and the device operates in the linear region under such conditions. Since the source is typically grounded, when the drain voltage is equal to \(V_{\text{gp}}\) - \(V_{\text{T}}\), the transistor operates in the saturation region, and \(V_{\text{pg}}\) acts as a switch throughout the process.

### _Top-gate Structure of OFETs_

The device structure in which the gate electrode is located above the semiconductor layer is collectively referred to as a top-gate structure. The gate dielectric layer in a top-gate structure can serve as encapsulation, eliminating the need for an additional encapsulation layer. The schematic diagram of molecular orientation shows that the molecular arrangement of the TC structure is more advantageous at the electrode-channel boundary(Figure 5). The orientation of organic semiconductor molecules is largely determined by the structure of the substrate. On bare metal surfaces, molecules tend to have an orientation parallel to the electrode surface, while on insulating surfaces, molecules are nearly perpendicular to the surface.

Hiroki M. et al. introduced a TGTC transistor, depicted in Figure 6[4]. This device incorporates \(\alpha\)-amorphous rubrene as the gate insulating layer and employs a delamination technique to establish the top-gate configuration. Studies have shown that \(\alpha\)-rubrene possesses excellent insulating characteristics, resulting in charge carrier mobilities ranging from 2.5\(\sim\)10\({}^{\circ}\)cm\({}^{2}\)V\({}^{-1}\)s\({}^{-1}\). This innovation presents significant potential for the development of high density OFET devices.

Zhang Jun and colleagues presented a lateral power device featuring a TGBC configuration based on organic semiconductors[5], illustrated in Figure 7. With a drift region measuring 20 micrometers, the device achieved a breakdown voltage of 2200 volts using a 50-nanometer thick semiconductor layer applied via spin-coating. The LDR-OFET, produced through a straightforward and

Fig. 5: Schematic diagram of the orientation of organic semiconductor molecules in TC structure cost-effective process, provides a promising option for applications requiring high breakdown voltages.

### _Bottom-gate Structure of OFETs_

For bottom-gate structures, only the deposition of the organic semiconductor layer and the source-drain electrodes are needed in silicon-based process, making the overall process simple. In BC structure, molecules are almost perpendicular to the surface(Figure 8). This leads to additional contact resistance at the electrode-channel boundary, suppressing charge carrier mobility. In order to mitigate the potential adverse effects of the BC structure, additional processing is needed to modify the surface of the channel region or electrodes, such as UV/ozone treatment.

In 2018, Shih A. proposed a high-voltage organic thin-film transistor with a bottom-gate top-contact structure[6], as shown in Figure 9. By employing an off-set channel architecture, the thickness of the organic semiconductor film could be reduced, had high-voltage capabilities up to 550V, an improvement of three-fold compared to previous results, offering high voltage tolerance and more flexible applications.

M.A. Smith et al. introduced a BGBC transistor[7], illustrated in Figure 10. This high-voltage organic transistor was developed using pentacene on a glass substrate. By implementing an offset drain-source architecture, the transistor was able to manage a significant drain-source voltage while requiring a lower gate voltage, enabling the drain to support a high voltage of 300V.

Summarize the above four types of structures and compare them as shown in Table 1.

## III Materials for OFETs

Although organic semiconductor materials have advantages such as mechanical flexibility, variable optical bandgap, and low-temperature large-area film formation, their breakdown voltage is much lower than traditional inorganic silicon-based semiconductors. Therefore, organic semiconductor materials with good thermal stability and high voltage resistance and high mobility have always been a research hotspot.

### _Polymers_

Polymers are materials composed of large molecules with chain like structures formed by the polymerization of

monomers. Their processing methods are simple and easy to form high-quality films, which can be printed on flexible substrates and are suitable for large-area electronic circuits. The improvement of polymer properties aims to enhance the conjugation and coplanarity of the main chain.

The conductivity of polymers can be controlled by doping or controlling the polymerization process. Key factors include main chain planarity, energy levels, crystallinity, and film morphology. High-performance polymers include P-type, ambipolar, and N-type polymers, but lower electron mobility and poorer device stability hinder the application of ambipolar or N-type polymer FETs. P-type polymer materials exhibit superior electrical performance. The most widely researched P-type polymer at present is diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) and its derivatives. As shown in Figure 11(a), the molecule of thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-diketopyrrolopyrrole is a derivative of DPP.

C. Kanimozh et al.[8] reported the synthesis of a diketopyrrolopyrrole-diketopyrrolo-pyrrole(DPP-DPP)-based conjugated **copolymer** and its application in high-mobility OFETs. Copolymerization of DPP with DPP yields a copolymer with exceptional properties such as electron mobility values of \(>\)1cm2V-1s-1.

Jung Ha Park et al. synthesized a series of conjugated polymers consisting of DPP and phenylene with different numbers of fluorine substitutions[9]. The polymer with four fluorine substitutions exhibits excellent charge-transport behavior, with an electron mobility of 2.36cm2V-1s-1.

Hewei Luo et al. reported a new and simple approach to enhance the charge carrier mobility(\(\sim\)26cm2V-1s-1) of DPP-thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-conjugated polymer by incorporating an ionic additive, tetramethylammonium iodide[10]. Shown in Figure 11(b). The resulting thin films exhibit a very high hole mobility, which is higher by a factor of 24 than that of thin films without the ionic additive.

### _Organic Small Molecule Compound_

Organic small molecule compounds refer to substances with relatively low molecular weight in organic compounds. Organic small molecule compounds have a wide range of applications in the manufacturing of semiconductor devices due to their unique electronic properties and ease of processing. Common N-type organic small molecule semiconductor materials include halogenated small molecules, cyanide small molecules, quinolone small molecules, etc. Common P-type organic small molecule semiconductors include pentacene, phthalocyanine compounds, rubrene, etc.[11]. By regulating the molecular structure, crystal morphology, and hybrid ligands of organic small molecule compounds, the original molecules are chemically modified to replace some functional groups or groups, thereby improving the stability **and** charge mobility of small molecules. It can achieve excellent charge transfer performance and controllable electrical characteristics and **can be used in the fabrication of** various organic field-effect transistors.

A mixture of MoS2 nanosheets mixed in the DA copolymer was developed and inkjet printed for the fabrication of thin-film transistors(TFTs)[12]. The I-V measurements of the fabricated TFTs indicated that the addition of MoS2 suspension (0.5wt%) into the polymer matrix resulted in the improvement of carrier mobility in both hole and electron transport, with an increase of 52% and 130%, respectively, compared to devices without the nanosheets.

Chen et al. use quantum chemistry methods to study the influence of pyrazine rings on typical pyrazine containing **molecules[13]**. The introduction of pyrazine possess excellent electronic transport properties and it is a type of N-type OFET material with good application prospects. Therefore, introducing pyrazine is an effective way to obtain excellent N-type OFET materials.

Liang Z et al. **demonstrated** that incorporating pyridine into pentacene derivatives can yield a carrier mobility of up to 3.3cm2V-1s-1[14], which makes this molecule one of the best performing N-**type** organic semiconductors.

In another significant advancement, Chu M et al. demonstrated that the tetrachlorore derivative in solution processed thin-film transistors exhibits electron mobility with a maximum value of 27.8cm2V-1s-1[15], which sets a new record for n-channel organic field-effect transistors.

D.Shukla et al. showed that by substituting alkyl or other groups at the nitrogen position of dicyanomethylene, the resulting compounds achieved an electron mobility of up to 6.2cm2V-1s-1. In contrast, naphthalene dimide (NDI) small molecules exhibited a significantly lower carrier mobility of only 10-cm2V-1s-1. This finding illustrates that modifying functional groups can effectively enhance the carrier mobility of small molecules[16]. This diagram is illustrated in Figure 12.

A comparison of the two materials is shown in Table 2.

## IV. Fabrication Methods of OFETs

In the configuration of organic power semiconductors, it is essential for the source and drain electrodes to establish direct contact with the semiconductor layer to ensure optimal performance. Conventional thermal evaporation techniques perhaps present a significant challenge in the fabrication of organic semiconductors. As a result, it becomes crucial to develop manufacturing processes that avoid damaging the delicate semiconductor layer. Achieving this goal involves minimizing contact resistance between the electrodes and the semiconductor, and enhancing carrier mobility. Hence, careful consideration of the methods and approaches used in the fabrication process is necessary to create high performance organic power semiconductors.

### _Fabrication by Solution Method_

The solution method mainly involves dissolving organic power semiconductor materials in organic solvents, and then forming thin films on the substrate through methods such as drip coating and spin coating. The advantage of this method is that the process is very simple, but the disadvantage is that if the spin coating quality is not high, the organic semiconductor film will be uneven, and there will be many disordered crystalline areas, resulting in high resistance.

The carrier mobility of thin film transistors prepared by Hoichang Yang et al. [17] using the drip method is in the range of 10\({}^{\text{-}}\)\(\sim\)10\({}^{\text{-}}\)cm\({}^{2}\)V-1s-1. The preparation process involves dissolving the organic semiconductor in different organic solvent droplets, dropping them onto the substrate, and then evaporating the organic solvent to form an organic semiconductor thin film.

The spin coating method is to first drop a solution containing dissolved organic semiconductors onto a substrate, then rotate it at high speed, and use centrifugal force to spread the solution on the entire substrate to form a uniform thin film. Then, the solvent is removed by **heating**, so the thickness and flatness of the thin film are directly controlled by the rotation and evaporation rate. The advantages of spin coating method are simple process, strong operability, low cost, and the ability to achieve large-scale production and OTFT preparation.

Yuan Y reported a simple, convenient, and highly aligned off-center spin coating method[2] for device fabrication, using a thiophene based polymer as the semiconductor to passivate the dielectric surface and improve the continuity of the thin film. The highest hole mobility obtained can reach 43cm\({}^{2}\)V-1s-1.

### _Thermal Evaporation Method_

The thermal evaporation technique involves placing organic semiconductor materials in a vacuum chamber, where they are deposited onto a substrate through thermal or laser evaporation. Films created using this approach exhibit enhanced crystallinity and purity, which contribute positively to the mobility of charge carriers and the overall performance of the device.

Arndt C. Durr[18] and colleagues examined the thermal stability of metal-organic interfaces using the thermal **evaporation** technique. Their research revealed that the characteristics of the interface are significantly influenced by the conditions under which the gold film is produced. When gold is deposited at a high rate and with a low substrate temperature, a distinct interface is formed with minimal diffusion between the two materials. Additionally, the substrate temperature can reach up to 150\({}^{\text{o}}\)C, which is adequate for the majority of technical applications involving metal contacts on organic semiconductors.

### _Inkjet Printing Method_

The inkjet printing technique involves the precise control of an inkjet head to directly deposit organic semiconductor materials onto a substrate, creating an organic thin film. This method eliminates the need for masking templates, resulting in significant material **savings**. However, the OTFTs typically exhibit low operating voltages and are primarily suitable for the fabrication of cost-effective, large-area devices.

H. Choi and colleagues[12] explored the use of MoS2 suspension to improve the charge transport capabilities of the donor-acceptor copolymer semiconductor DPPT-TT for the fabrication of inkjet-printed thin-film transistors.

### _Self-assembly Technology_

Self-assembly technology involves organic molecules organizing themselves into specific structures within organic semiconductor materials. This approach enables meticulous
