###### Abstract

We developed two mid-infrared quantum cascade laser structures based on InAs quantum dashes embedded either in AlInGaAs lattice-matched to InP or in tensile-strained AlInAs. Both devices emit between 7 and 11 \(\mu\)m.

## 1 Introduction

Now-a-days quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) are well-established coherent sources of radiation in the mid-infrared (IR) and terahertz regions. Even though in the mid-IR these devices work extremely well, they could still benefit from improved threshold currents and higher wall plug efficiencies. It has been proposed that replacing the quantum wells (QWs) in the active region by quantum dots (QDs) would decrease the scattering mechanism caused by the lack of in-plane confinement of QWs, which leads to the above-mentioned limitations [1].

So far mid-IR electroluminescence from quantum cascade structures has focused on the GaAs material system [2], which allows for easy InAs QDs formation by Stranski-Krastanov epitaxial growth mode. Unfortunately, in this material system, electron extraction from the QDs is very difficult. On the other hand, it is easier in the InP material system, where one could also profit from well-known processes which allow for excellent thermal extraction leading to record performances [3]. The disadvantage of this system is that the InAs QDs growth results in quantum dash (QDash) or wire formation due to the lower strain between InAs and InP. Nonetheless, InAs/InP QDash interband lasers have been demonstrated in the near IR and photodetectors in the mid-IR [4, 5]. Here we show for the first time electroluminescence from InAs QDash-based QCL structures.

## 2 Experiment and discussion

The devices developed in this experiment were grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on slightly n doped InP. The two designs can be seen in Fig. 1. In the first design, 4 ML of InAs QDashes were embedded in a lattice-matched Al\({}_{0.238}\)In\({}_{0.528}\)Ga\({}_{0.234}\)As QW. These QDashes have a broad (88 meV) room temperature (RT) photoluminescence (PL) peaked at 850 \(\mathrm{meV}\). The goal of this design was to inject electrons in the excited state of the QDashes/wetting layer (WL), after capturing them in the first energy level of the AlInGaAs QW, and to extract them via the following InGaAs QWs, as shown in Fig. 1a. Emission could then occur either from the excited state of the QDashes/WL to their ground state (a vertical transition, red arrow) or from the QDashes ground state to the first level in the following InGaAs QW (a diagonal transition, blue arrow). In the second design, the InAs QDashes were embedded in tensile-strained Al\({}_{0.64}\)In\({}_{0.36}\)As, and their broader (150 meV) RT PL was peaked at around 920 \(\mathrm{meV}\). In this design, shown in Fig. 1b, we aimed directly at a diagonal transition from the ground state of the QDashes to the first energy level in the following InGaAs QW (red arrow).

## 3 Conclusions

Two different QCL structures based on InAs QDashes were developed and tested. They both emit light in the region between 110 and 170 meV (7-11 \(\mu\)m). The design based on QDashes grown on strained AlInAs seems more promising for the realization of a QCL based on a 3-d confined active region.
