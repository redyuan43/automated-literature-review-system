## I Introduction

In early 2004 an issue was identified whereby numerous process toolsets were experiencing excessive down time due to repeated fails for monitor wafer foreign material (FM) tests in the IBM 300mm semiconductor manufacturing facility in Hopewell Junction, NY. A tracked metric known as tool FM percent "Out of Control" (FM % OOC) was running above specified limits, resulting in excessive tool down time. This tool downtime had a direct impact on the ability of the fab to meet its cycle time and customer output commitments. To address this problem, executive management established an FM Initiative working group whose mission was to identify and address the causes of the elevated tool failure rates. The two key objectives of the FM Initiative were:

* Reduce the number of tool fails in the fab for FM as measured by FM % OOC. The stated goal: achieve an aggressive target of 50% reduction in tool fails by end of the 3rd quarter of 2004 (3Q04).
* Improve overall tool particulate defectivity as measured on FM monitor wafers by developing and driving toolset and fab "cleanliness" metrics and aligning top strategic actions with a focus on improving tool based FM, fab environment based FM, and monitor wafer metrology robustness.

The FM Initiative was kicked off March 2004 in a series of meetings between internal management and Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) tool supplier representatives. OEM representatives were informed of the need to work together as a team to reduce tool FM failure rates on the respective toolsets through rapid implementation of FM reduction step down plans and deep dive of "hi-flyer" toolsets.

## II Focus Areas and Results

In order to make rapid progress in achievement of defined goals, four key focus areas of the FM Initiative were defined. These were 1) OEM tool supplier FM deep dive reviews, 2) Monitor wafer quality optimization, 3) Clean environment improvement and controls, and 4) Monitor wafer measurement metrology improvements. An overview of each of these focus areas and results achieved in each is presented.

### OEM Tool Supplier FM Deep Dive Reviews

Teams were established for each toolset with recognized internal subject matter experts identified as team lead/champions. OEM tool supplier representative participants were identified as well. Suppliers were requested to make available for participation their own internal subject matter experts on tool platform performance and defectivity. The purpose of the team was to perform a "Deep Dive" review of the tool platform performance, in other words, an in depth analysis of all aspects of tool function that could impact tool defectivity metrics. Each team also had identified internal representatives from each of the following areas: equipment maintenance and engineering, process engineering, manufacturing, industrial engineering, integrated supply chain/wafer engineering, 300mm controls, facilities engineering, quality assurance, and the automated materials handling teams. The key goal of each of the deep dive teams was to drive rapid identification and implementation of strategic continuous improvement projects (CIPs) and other best known practices targeted at reducing contamination levels and defects. These CIPs and best practices were identified by the OEM representatives jointly with the internal team members, and structured in the form of a step down plan to reduce tool FM % OOC on each specific toolset. OEM representatives were asked to draw upon the knowledge and experience on tool defect reduction from their respective world-wide manufacturing and development activities.

Participation was very strong due to the high level management focus and the need to achieve positive results rapidly. Weekly team meetings were established, first to determine root causes of tool FM % OOC fallout and define step down actions to reduce same. In the mid to latter stages, meetings served to drive schedule and implementation of step down plans and quantify results of actions. Figure 1 provides an example of a supplier defined step-down result chart, showing the base line results for FM mean particle counts and FM % OOC, the projected FM % OOC performance improvement based upon defined actions, and finally the actual resulting performance per month for both mean particle adders and the overall tool FM % OOC metric. As can be seen in this example, the actual results significantly exceeded the projection.

In majority of cases, the joint team effort resulted in dramatic reduction of tool FM mean particle counts and resulting improvement in FM % OOC. In cases where OEM tool suppliers were not meeting contractual obligations for FM tool defect levels, the suppliers were responsible for addressing those deficiencies. If a supplier was meeting contractual obligations, but further improvements were desired or deemed to be required to meet production goals, additional expenditures were evaluated and decision to implement was made based on projected return on investment (ROI) for a given proposed CIP.

By the end of 3Q04, 17 out of 24 defined toolsets had achieved the 50% tool FM % OOC reduction target. By the end of 4Q04, 22 of 24 toolsets had achieved the 50% target. Several toolsets were unable to achieve the targeted improvement by end of the year.

In order to maintain the improvements after the conclusion of the FM Initiative, suppliers of each tool set were required to complete definition and implementation of tool "Out of Control Actions Plans" (OCAPs). These OCAPs called for differentiated actions for "one out of one" FM monitor wafer failures, vs. "two out of two", or "two out of three" consecutive FM monitor wafer failures. The latter two cases are indicative of a more systemic problem that must be addressed with a more aggressive set of actions than that of the case of "one out of one" failure.

### _Monitor Wafer Quality Optimization_

Different types of monitor wafers are required for specific applications, for example insulator levels required oxy/nitride films; whereas implant or earlier layers may require base silicon monitor wafers [1]. In addition, the requirement for incoming monitor wafer quality, e.g. the number of incoming Light Point Defects (LPDs), varies on criticality of process, based on potential for resultant killed die for a defect at a given process step. LPDs are defined to be either surface particles or Crystal Originated Pits (COPs) in the surface of the wafer. While not a particulate defect per se, a COP can still contribute to higher incoming fail counts as identified by a machine vision system such as a KLA-Tencor SPI\({}^{\ast}\). An elevated fail count can make it more difficult to achieve tool FM specification requirements. A significant effort was made to work with suppliers of new prime and reclaim monitor wafers to optimize incoming quality of wafers to be used for specific tool monitoring applications, while keeping a handle on costs. The result of this focus area was to reduce the specification for incoming prime and reclaim monitor wafers from \(<\) 200 LPDs at a 0.16\(\upmu\)m minimum defect size to \(<\) 60 LPDs _@_ 0.12\(\upmu\)m at no additional cost. This resulted in much tighter control of monitor wafer incoming defect levels at a smaller, more exacting particle size. Additionally, a mid-range monitor wafer specification was established for reclaim wafers with 60-120 LPDs _@_ 0.12\(\upmu\)m in order to expand usage and flexibility of choice of the reclaim wafer supply at the smaller defect size. The key result of this focus area was that the fab was able to migrate to 60-70% reclaim wafer usage versus prime for the 2\({}^{\text{nd}}\) six months of 2004 compared to 40% during the 1\({}^{\text{st}}\) half of 2004 with no resultant degrade in performance and at significant resulting cost savings.

### _Clean Environment Improvements/Controls_

Analytical laboratory analysis of fab and tool surface contamination samples had shown high levels of numerous contaminants deleterious to the semiconductor manufacturing process such as trace metallics, in-organics, organic compounds, and human contamination related compounds. Similar analysis of tool interior surfaces provided evidence that those contamination components found on fab and tool exterior surfaces were also on tool interior surfaces as well as process chambers as evidenced by testing monitor wafers. Based on this result it was decided to ramp up fab and tool surface contamination controls to mitigate potential cross contamination from tool exterior to tool interior. A fab-wide "Superclean" was completed in which all surfaces, tool and facility, were thoroughly cleaned via HEPA

vacuuming and triple wipping with cleanroom wipers and a DI water/Isopropyl Alcohol (IPA) solution. Following this major cleaning activity, a regularly scheduled tool and fab surface cleaning procedure was implemented in which surfaces were cleaned to an empirically defined specification as measured by a surface particulate measurement tool.

When fab operation was started, a relaxed protocol for garmenting was established based on the fact that wafers in 300mm manufacturing always reside in an enclosed Front-Opening Unified Pods (FOUP) for wafer transport, and in integrated mini-environment factory interfaces when transferred out of FOUP and into the process tool. Based on the aforementioned analytical lab results, the decision was made to upgrade cleanroom protocols to be more consistent with Institute of Environmental Science and Technology (IEST) [2] recommendations for an ISO Class 5 cleanroom environment [3], which include the following: jumpsuit garment, bouffant, face veil, hood, gloves and shoe covers.

In addition to cleanroom improvements, efforts were made to control the actual environment that the wafers were exposed to inside FOUPs and internal to tool mini-environments. It is well documented [4] that static charge on wafers attracts contaminants out of the air in clean environments. In fact, when wafers are highly charged, this effect often is the dominant source of contamination [5, 6]. An internal 2003 study of impact of ionization on tool particulate performance had confirmed previous external studies [7] that established that use of ionization within a clean environment can reduce Per Wafer Pass (PWP) particle adders versus the case of not ionizing the environment. An additional study [8] had shown that use of ionization in cleaning tools can greatly improve tool cleaning efficiency.

Based upon these results, a project was initiated to install ionizers in the majority of tool mini-environments. Initially, 20% of tools as delivered had ionizers installed in mini-environments. The result of this project was to drive to 95% of tools with ionizers installed.

In many cases improvement was measured in FM mean particle counts, an example of which is shown in Fig. 2. With ionization turned on the distribution of mean particle adders was improved, as well as a reduction in high flyer failures achieved.

Another method of controlling the wafer environment was to impose controls on the cleanliness of FOUPs in the manufacturing line. FOUPs are exchanged at several points in the process flow and at the end of wafer processing. At these points the empty FOUPs are sent to a cleaning process. A Liquid Particle Count (LPC) tool was installed in the FOUP clean area during the FM Initiative. The purpose of this tool was to measure contamination levels in FOUPs post clean to assure that FOUPs were meeting empirically defined cleanliness levels. A sample methodology for measuring cleaned FOUPs was established with statistical process controls (SPC) controls and OCAPs defined.

### _Monitor Wafer Metrology Improvements_

Prior to the FM Initiative, tool FM monitor wafer performance was determined by use of a delta FM method, which involved measuring the total difference in particle adders on a wafer first measured prior to running the wafer through a process tool (pre-measurement), then again after the toolwafer check is run (post-measurement). The net delta in particle counts between the pre- and post- measurements was therefore the value for FM counts for that tool check. However this delta FM method can provide inaccurate information regarding number of true adders in a process step.

During the FM Initiative, a prior level subtraction (PLS) strategy was implemented whereby physical positions of particles were compared between pre- and post- measurements in order to determine a more accurate number of true adders for a given process step (see figure 3).

Another key activity of this focus area was the migration of the tools control strategy from using the same FM parti

cle upper control limit (UCL) specification on like tools/chambers across an entire fleet of tools to a SPC derived set of UCLs uniquely defined for a tool or chamber based upon that specific tool's capability. Often there are chambers which fail more frequently than the majority of others in a fleet, or conversely perform better than the bulk of the fleet. SPC derived UCLs allow a chamber to be controlled according to its abilities while not incurring excessive tool down time to FM % OOC failure. An action plan to drive a specific tool to perform in line with fleet performance can then be defined. In addition, enhanced clustering algorithms were implemented; as well as a focused effort on particle inspection (SP1) tool matching to improve FM monitor accuracy. Key result of this focus area: significantly more accurate quantification of tool particle adders.

## 4 Overall Results

One of the stated objectives of the FM Initiative was to reduce overall FM % OOC by 50% between 2Q04 and end of 3Q04. In fact FM % OOC exceeded this goal by reducing the metric by 55% in that time period. Throughout 4Q04, benefits were still being achieved; the result was even greater improvement (Fig. 4).

The second stated goal of the FM Initiative was to improve overall tool particulate defectivity as measured on FM monitor wafers. A measurement referred to as the "Defect Dow" was used to track mean monitor wafer particulate performance by tool type. The net result was an overall fab tool particulate defectivity reduction as measured on FM monitor wafer of 45% as measured from the start of the FM initiative to end of 3Q04. Figure 5 shows this normalized result as measured via the Defect Dow tracking metric, broken out by process sector.

A fortuitous result of the tool performance improvements, were corresponding accelerated improvements in product yields across technologies beyond original projections (Fig. 6). In particular, the dramatic accelerated yield improvement achieved in the September and October time frame was due to the random defect density (RDD) reduction directly attributable to the clean environment improvements.

## 5 Conclusion

The multifaceted FM Initiative effort was very successful in achieving the defined objectives and enabling dramatic yield improvements on new technologies. A key element that allowed for the success of the FM Initiative was the buy-in between high level internal management and the OEM tool supplier's management teams, in the majority of cases allowing for rapid closure on CIPs. Successful completion of the FM Initiatives stated goals was a Win-Win for the majority of OEM and internal participants, provid

ing beneficial learning for both sides. The focus on environmental and tool exterior contamination reduction resulted in establishing the capability for surface contamination external to tools to migrate into the tools and as a result impact product. Strict environment controls and cleaning protocols are required, even in the case of 300mm manufacturing with associated FOUPs and integrated mini-environments intended to isolate the product. Finally, the focus on increased monitor wafer quality and associated monitor wafer metrology enhancements resulted in more accurate measurement of tool defectivity and FM SPC control by chamber. This allowed for tools to be controlled to their true capability, instead of experiencing excessive failures from being controlled to a specification that was overly restrictive. Or conversely having a tool never fail and hence not reveal any tool variation due to a lax specification for tool FM performance.
