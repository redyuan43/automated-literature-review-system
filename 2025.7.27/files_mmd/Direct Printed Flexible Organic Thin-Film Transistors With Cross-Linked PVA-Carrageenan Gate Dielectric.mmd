## I Introduction

With the growing interest in wearable electronics and sensor devices, flexibility has become a desirable attribute of next-generation electronics [1]. Organic thin-film transistors (OTFT) are well established, uniquely tunable for compatibility with large-area, low-cost processing techniques. Additive printing processes, such as inkier printing, screen printing, and reel-to-reel printing, have been used for flexible electronic systems in a low-cost, high-throughput manner with excellent repeatability and efficiency. Fan et al. [2] demonstrated 3-D-printing transistors with polylactic acid (PLA), silver ink, and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), which showed great transconductance properties. However, most current OTFTs are processed with hazardous solvents and expensive gate dielectric materials (metal oxides, self-assembled monolayers, high k ceramic dielectrics, etc.) made from rare Earth and petrochemical resources. Hazardous, aggressive solvents can prevent the use of certain device architectures or additive manufacturing altogether. The final devices are often inherently not biocompatible due to residual materials and material incompatibilities, limiting their usability for biosensing and bioelectronics applications.

The solution to these challenges is green electronics. Green electronics are biodegradable, sustainable, recyclable, and rely on materials sourced from renewable resources. An added benefit of these materials is that they are generally processable using mild solvents and temperatures, with excellent biocompatibility. Hou et al. [3] produced a PLA-polyhydroxy butyrate composite bioplastic substrate that is suitable as a substrate for electronics. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) composites are often used in their hydrogel form as charge-trapping elements in energy storage devices, or as charge carrier structures for conductive traces [4, 5, 6, 7]. Carrageenanan (CAR), which is a biopolymer material sourced from seaweed, can be effectively crosslinked at low temperatures, and has already been implemented as both bioelectrolytic and structural biomaterial for resolvable implants [8, 9]. Crosslinking of CAR with porous polymers, such as PVA, significantly improves the mechanical and electrical characteristics [10, 11], which makes cross-linked PVA-CAR a favorable candidate as gate dielectric material in green electronics. Literature processes cross-linked PVA and CAR in bulk volumes prior to deposition. This leads to pore sizes (PVA in CAR) of up to 5 \(\mu\)m [12], limiting the minimum thickness of bulk cross-linked material depositions and its applicability as gate dielectric in OTFTs.

In this letter, we demonstrate a novel approach to produce robust, on-surface cross-linked PVA-CAR dielectric films as part of

the additive manufacturing process for metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitors and direct printed, metal-free OTTFs. By depositing the materials before crosslinking, we have better control of the dielectric thickness, beneficial for depositing thin films. As capacitors, the devices demonstrate outstanding dielectric constant in the low-frequency range, compared with the PV-PMMA capacitor with a 4.5 dielectric constant at 100 kHz and a 13.3 nF/cm\({}^{2}\) capacitance density published by Salim et al. [13]. The PVA-CAR OTTFs demonstrate excellent device characteristics (gate leakage, on/off ratio, and output current) when compared with the conventional polymer gate dielectric, polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA).

## II Materials and Methods

### _Materials_

The materials used include semirefined k-CAR(Xi'an Lyphar Biotech, Co., Ltd.), 98% hydrolyzed PVA (Sigma Aldrich), 7% 950 PMMA in anisole (Sigma Aldrich), 5.0 wt% PEDOT:PSS ink (Agfa Orgacon), 6,13-Bis(triisopropylylethynyl) pentacene (TIPSpentacene) (Sigma Aldrich, USA), and low-temperature curable silver epoxy (EJ2189-LV, Epo-Tek).

### _Methods_

_1) Capacitor Fabrication Process: PVA-CAR dielectric:_ A total of 10% solutions of PVA and CARin deionized (DI) water are mixed in a 3:1 ratio and stirred for 180 min. The mixed solution is then placed in a vacuum chamber for 60 min to remove air bubbles. The solution is spin coated on the bottom electrode surface and freeze-flawed over five cycles for 12 h each at \(-5^{\circ}\)C, followed by 8 h at room temperature. The PVA-CAR material is then covered by a second 190 nm of 2% PVA in DI water layer by spin coating at 100 r/min for 5 s, and 2500 r/min for 40 s.

The MIM capacitor devices [see Fig. 1(a) and (d)] were fabricated on 2-in compassivated silicon wafers. A 200-nm thick chromium (Cr) bottom electrode layer was deposited through electron beam deposition. Then, the Cr surface was cleaned with acetone and isopropyl alcohol, and the PVA-CAR film of two target thicknesses 2.0 and 1.7 \(\mu\)m was deposited by a sequence of spin-coating steps for 60 s at 4000 and 6000 r/min. A silver top electrode layer is then extrusion printed using a 3-D biobitometer (EnvisionTEC, USA) with a 27-gauge tapered extrusion tip.

_2) Organic Thin-Film Transistor Fabrication Process:_ The OTTF devices are bottom gate bottom contact structures printed on polyaniline (Kapton, Dupont) after surface cleaning [see Fig. 1(b), (c), and (f)]. PEDOT:PSS gate electrodes were extrusion printed using the 3-D Biophotter [see Fig. 1(e)]. The PVA-CAR and PVA-PMMA dielectrics were then deposited to a thickness of 600 nm, followed by PEDOT:PSS source-drain electrodes, all printed using the 3-D Biophotter. The transistor channel length is 100 \(\mu\)m, and aspect ratio is 20. The organic semiconductor, 2% wt. solution of TIPS-Pentacene in 49% Xylene and 49% chlorobenzene, is then drop-casted onto the source-drain electrodes, and the solvent is allowed to dry slowly at room temperature. A thin encapsulation layer of PVA is spin deposited on top to protect the organic semiconductor. The entire stack is then annealed at 60 \({}^{\circ}\)C for 15 min.

_PVA-PMMA:_ In total, 600 nm of PMMA is spin coated onto the bottom gate using a spread of 1000 r/min for 8 s followed by a spin of 4000 r/min for 45 s. After a 3-min hardbake at 180 \({}^{\circ}\)C, a PVA layer same as the PVA-CAR dielectric stack is added.

The transistor devices were characterized using the HP4156 semiconductor parameter analyzer. The output characteristics were measured using a VSD sweep of 0-10 V, for a range of VSG values over 0-15 V. Hold values of 20 ms were used at each data point to capture steady-state values. _I-V_ data graphed with n \(>\) 3. MIM capacitors were measured using the Agilent 4294 precision impedance analyzer.

## III Results and Discussion

### _Characterizing the PVA-CAR MIM Capacitors_

The complex impedance and phase angle of the prepared PVA-CAR stack capacitors were measured using an ac signal with amplitude 50 mV and a frequency spectrum of 40-100 MHz. Using (1), the real and imaginary parts of the impedance values were calculated from the complex impedance measurements. The loss tangent versus frequency plot is, then, shown in Fig. 1, and the dielectric constant of the samples with different PVA-CAR film thicknesses are demonstrated and compared in Fig. 2.

\[\varepsilon^{\prime}_{r}=\left(\frac{t}{A\varepsilon_{0}}\right) \left(\frac{1}{2\pi f}\right)\left(\frac{Z^{*}}{Z^{2}+Z^{*2}}\right)\] \[\varepsilon^{*}_{r}=\left(\frac{t}{A\varepsilon_{0}}\right) \left(\frac{1}{2\pi f}\right)\left(\frac{Z^{*}}{Z^{2}+Z^{*2}}\right) \tag{1}\]

\[\text{Capacitance Density}=\varepsilon^{\prime}_{r}\frac{\varepsilon_{0}}{t}. \tag{2}\]

The samples with different PVA-CAR layer thicknesses show a similar trend on the loss tangent plot, whereas the samples with a thicker PVA-CAR organic layer shows a larger loss constant at around 85 MHz. The negativity of the loss tangent in Fig. 2 and the dielectric constant in Fig. 3 is caused by negative phase angle measurements, which indicate a leading effect of the charges versus the applied voltage caused by the existence of the bioelectryptic in the material. The samples with different dielectric thicknesses demonstrated a similar dielectric constant over the frequency spectrum, as shown in Fig. 3. The samples with a thicker PVA-CAR organic layer generate a slightly higher absolute value of dielectric constant below 70 M frequency. The PVA-CAR MIM devices yielded an average absolute value of dielectric constant of 22.36 at 40 Hz frequency, and the permittivity drops expectedly as the frequency increases over 75 MHz. Using (2),

all PVA-CAR capacitors achieved an average capacitance density of \(\sim\)163 nF/cm\({}^{2}\) at the frequency range of 40 Hz, which outperforms traditional flexible dielectric materials.

### Cross-linked PVA-CAR Implemented in OTFTs

The transfer characteristics delineate the linear and saturation regions of the OTFT devices, as well as the device subthreshold region. Device operating characteristics are extracted using a modified Marinov OTFT model (3) and gate dielectric per unit area capacitance terms (4). Gate leakage current is monitored in all OTFT tests, measuring leakage current in the range of 0.2-52.8 nA.

\[I_{S}=\frac{\mu_{0}}{V_{\mathrm{sat}}^{\alpha}}\hat{c}_{Li}\left(\frac{W}{L} \right)(V_{SG}-|V_{I}|)^{1+\gamma}V_{SD} \tag{3}\]

\[\hat{c}_{\mathrm{PVA-CAR}}=\left(\frac{1}{\hat{c}_{\mathrm{PVA-CAR}}}+\frac{1 }{\hat{c}_{PVA}}\right)^{-1};\quad\hat{c}_{\mathrm{PMMA}}=\left(\frac{1}{\hat {c}_{\mathrm{PMMA}}}+\frac{1}{\hat{c}_{\mathrm{PVA}}}\right)^{-1}. \tag{4}\]

PVA-PMMA and PVA-CAR gate OTFT devices demonstrated the expected transistor action of increasing device current with increasing \(V_{SG}\). The device turn-on voltage for transistor current modulation is observed, where source drain current (\(I_{SD}\)) is dependent on the applied gate bias. The \(I\)-\(V\) curves demonstrated the device overdrive voltage of \(-4\) V for both sets of OTFT devices. This is significant as it demonstrates that our devices reach saturation with low applied voltages.

The PVA-PMMA OTFT devices demonstrate the expected transistor \(I\)-\(V\) behavior and gate-modulated device behavior (see Fig. 4); however, the resolution between applied gate bias traces is small. The dielectric constant of PMMA is low, around 2.8, compared with PVA of about nine, which contributes to the lower output currents in these devices.

The PVA-CAR OTFTs demonstrated expected transistor behavior including superior gate modulation at low gate biases (see Fig. 4). The device on/off ratio is on the scale of \(10^{5}\)-\(10^{6}\), comparable to literature examples of high-performance OTFTs.

As seen from Table 1, the extracted per unit area gate capacitance and on/off ratio of the PVA-CAR transistors are a factor of 10 higher than the PMMA device. As the only difference in the two stacks is the substitution of PMMA for cross-linked green dielectric PVA-CAR, the increased output currents can be attributed to the improvement from the cross-linked dielectric material. In the subthreshold region, one of the main contributing factors to gate voltage is semiconductor device structure and charge mobility. The highly comparable device turn-on between the two device structures indicates that the organic semiconductor layer is consistent between the device structures, despite being printed on different polymer materials. Despite the excellent OTFT characteristics observed in the fully additive device structures, the use of direct printed, polymer-based source-drain and gate electrodes increases the trace and contact resistance at gate. This is particularly evident in the PMMA-PVA device, which has lower device output currents, where it is clear that the resistivity of the traces has contributed to the poor gate modulation.

Future devices will be further optimized to further lower the leakage current and improve device current at low gate biases. Improving the success rate of the transistor prints should be addressed by optimizing the direct printing process. This highly promising green polymer gate dielectric material is suitable for flexible electronics for sensory applications and wearables.

## IV Conclusion

This is the first implementation of on-surface, low-temperature crosslinking of PVA-CAR gate dielectric in a metal-free, direct printed OTFT structure where the on-surface crosslinking allows for creating robust thin-film green polymer gate dielectric for OTFT implementations. With an average real dielectric permittivity of 22.36 at 40 Hz, the cross-linked PVA-CAR dielectric layer revealed consistently superior dielectric characteristics to other commonly used copolymer gate dielectrics. The direct printed PVA-CAR OTFT is being reported for the first time, and demonstrated a low gate leakage current of 10-52.8 nA, low device overrid voltage of \(-4\) V, and remarkable on/off ratio in the range of \(10^{4}\)-\(10^{6}\). With the fully organic and fully flexible nature of the PVA-CAR OTFT, it becomes an ideal candidate for the application in environmental-friendly flexible electronic biosensor and bioelectronic systems. In future studies, the performance of the PVA-CAR OTFT under different operating conditions, such as temperature, humidity, under large bending loads, and aging effects, will be tested for suitability in the green electronic sensor system applications.
