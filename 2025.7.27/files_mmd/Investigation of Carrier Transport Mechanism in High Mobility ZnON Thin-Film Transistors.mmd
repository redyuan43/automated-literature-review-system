## I Introduction

O'F'LATE, zinc oxpiritride (ZnON) is attracting a considerable attention as a channel material of the high-mobility thin-film transistor (TFT) for next-generation large-size, high-resolution, and high-frame rate displays [1, 2]. ZnON TFTs exhibit a high field-effect mobility (\(\mu_{\text{FE}}\)) of \(\sim\)100 cm\({}^{2}\)/V-s owing to the small effective mass of an electron in ZnON [2, 3]. In addition, the substitution of oxygen with nitrogen in ZnO reduces the energy band gap to 1.3 eV, which eliminates the deep levels near the valence band maximum formed by oxygen vacancies. Therefore, a significant improvement in photo-stability has been reported in ZnON TFTs compared to the multi-cation amorphous oxide TFTs including amorphous indium-gallium-zinc oxide (a-IGZO) TFTs [4]. In the last several years, various studies have been performed to improve the electrical performances of ZnON TFTs [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. However, the carrier transport mechanism in the ZnON TFT remains under debate even though the impurity scattering [1], percolation conduction [2], and trap-limited conduction [9] have been considered as possible carrier transport mechanisms in the ZnON TFTs. Knowledge about the carrier transport mechanism is essential for both obtaining a fundamental understanding of the device operation and improving the device performances. In this work, we systematically investigate the carrier transport mechanism in the ZnON TFT by analyzing the gate bias and temperature dependence of conductance and intrinsic field-effect mobility (\(\mu_{\text{FEI}}\)) in the subthreshold and above-threshold regions, respectively.

## II Device Fabrication

In this study, experiments were performed in the ZnON TFT with an inverted-staggered and etch-stopper structure. The fabrication procedure of the device is as follows. A Mo (200 nm) gate was patterned on a glass substrate, and then a SiN\({}_{\text{X}}\) (350 nm)/SiO\({}_{2}\) (50 nm) was formed by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). Next, a ZnON thin-film (50 nm) was grown by sputtering and then patterned. The ZnON channel area was protected by an etch-stopper layer of SiO\({}_{2}\) (100 nm) to prevent damage to the back channel during the etching process of source/drain electrodes. The deposition of the ZnON thin-film was performed using a Zn metal target at a gas flow rate of Ar/N\({}_{2}\)/O\({}_{2}\) = 10/100/2. In sequence, a source/drain of AlNd was patterned by dry etching, and the TFT was passivated by the SiO\({}_{2}\) passivation layer. Fig. 1 depicts a cross-sectional view of the fabricated ZnON TFT. The electrical parameters of the fabricated ZnON TFT extracted from the device with a

width/length (\(W\)/\(L\)) of 50 \(\mu\)m/50 \(\mu\)m are as follows: a \(\mu_{\rm FE}\) of 119.2 cm\({}^{2}\)/V-s, threshold voltage (\(V_{\rm th}\)) of 0.6 V, subthreshold slope (\(S\)S) of 0.62 V/dec, and turn-on voltage (\(V_{\rm on}\)) of \(-\)5.2 V. The \(\mu_{\rm FE}\) of the fabricated ZnON TFT is higher than \(\mu_{\rm FE}\)s of the previously reported ZnON TFTs (\(\sim\)40 - 100 cm\({}^{2}\)/V-s [8, 9, 10, 11, 12]) and conventional a-IGZO TFTs (\(\sim\)10 - 20 cm\({}^{2}\)/V-s [13]). Here, \(\mu_{\rm FE}\) was extracted from the maximum transconductance at a drain-to-source voltage (\(V_{\rm DS}\)) of 0.1 V and \(V_{\rm th}\) was determined by the intercept of the extrapolated curve with a voltage axis. \(V_{\rm on}\) was defined as the onset voltage at which the drain current (\(I_{\rm D}\)) increases.

## 3 Results and Discussion

Fig. 2(a) presents the transfer curves of the ZnON TFT measured by increasing the temperature from RT (23 \({}^{\rm o}\)C) to 80 \({}^{\rm o}\)C. Measurements were performed in air, and the device was placed on the heated chuck which was set at the measurement temperature for 30 mins for thermal equilibrium. Fig. 2(a) shows that \(V_{\rm on}\) moves in the negative direction and \(S\)S continuously increases with an increase of temperature. \(I_{\rm D}\) in the above-threshold region exhibits an almost constant value in all measurement temperatures. The temperature-dependent variation in the transfer curve was reversible because it recovered to the initial one when the temperature decreased to RT. Fig. 2(b) presents the \(I_{\rm D}\) versus 1/\(kT\) plot depicted as a function of the gate-to-source voltage (\(V_{\rm GS}\)) in the subthreshold region, where \(T\) is the temperature and \(k\) is the Boltzmann constant. Fig. 2(b) shows that the temperature dependence of \(I_{\rm D}\) can be expressed by the Arrhenius equation of

\[I_{D}=I_{D0}\exp(-E_{a}/kT), \tag{1}\]

where \(I_{D0}\) is the prefactor and \(E_{a}\) is the activation energy. \(I_{\rm D0}\) and \(E_{a}\) can be extracted from Fig. 2(b) as a function of \(V_{\rm GS}\). Fig. 3(a) shows the variation of \(I_{D0}\)plotted as a function of \(E_{a}\), which denotes that \(I_{D0}\) increases exponentially with \(E_{a}\). It obeysthe Meyer-Neldel (MN) rule, which is the intrinsic property of a disordered semiconductor [14, 15, 16, 17]. Similar experimental results were reported in a-IGZO TFTs in the subthreshold region [18, 19]. The MN rule has been explained by a trap-limited conduction model and a statistical shift of the Fermi level [16, 17, 18, 19]. The experimental data in Fig. 3(a) show that the dominant carrier transport mechanism in the ZnON TFT in the subthreshold region is the trap-limited conduction. Eq. (2) is the MN equation

\[I_{D0}=I_{D00}\exp(A\cdot E_{a}), \tag{2}\]

where \(I_{\rm D00}\) is the prefactor for \(I_{D0}\) and\(A\) is the characteristic MN parameter. From Eq. (2) and the experimental data in Fig. 3(a), an almost constant value of \(A\) (15.01 eV\({}^{-1}\)) is obtained over \(E_{\rm aS}\) between 0.02 and 0.32 eV. In the trap-limited conduction model, the conduction characteristics are strongly affected by multiple trapping and thermal release events associated with the localized tail states. As the temperature increases, more carriers are thermally activated from the trap sites to the conduction band, and they move quickly to the drain electrode on account of the lateral electric field. Fig. 3(b) shows the surface energy distribution of the subgap density of states (DOS) extracted from the temperature-dependent field-effect characteristics of the fabricated ZnON TFT in the subthreshold region based on the MN rule [18, 19].

To investigate the intrinsic carrier transport mechanism in the ZnO TFT in the above-threshold region, \(\mu_{\rm FEi}\) of the device was extracted using the transmission line method [20]. In Fig. 4(a), the total resistances between the source and drain electrodes of the TFT (\(R_{\rm T}\)s) are plotted as a function of \(L\) for different \(V_{\rm GS}\)s. The contact resistance (\(R_{\rm C}\)) is extracted from the \(R_{\rm T}\)-axis intercept as a function of \(V_{\rm GS}\), and \(\mu_{\rm FEi}\) is obtained by Eq. (3) after excluding the contact resistance effects.

\[\mu_{FEi}=\frac{\partial I_{D}}{\partial V_{GS}}\cdot\frac{1}{(W/L)C_{i}(V_{ DS}-I_{D}R_{C})}, \tag{3}\]

where, \(C_{\rm i}\) is the gate dielectric capacitance per unit area. Fig. 4(b) compares \(R_{\rm C}\) and the channel resistance (\(R_{\rm ch}\)) extracted from the device with a \(W/L\) of 50 \(\mu\)m/50 \(\mu\)m at RT, and calculates \(R_{\rm C}/R_{\rm T}\) as a function of \(V_{\rm GS}\), where \(R_{\rm T}=R_{\rm ch}+R_{\rm C}\). The width-normalized contact resistances calculated from the extracted \(R_{\rm C}\)s in Fig. 4(b) are similar with those of a-IGZO TFTs [21, 22, 23]. Fig. 4(b) shows that the contribution of \(R_{\rm C}\) continuously increases with an increase of the gate overdrive voltage (\(V_{\rm OV}=V_{\rm GS}-V_{\rm th}\)). It shows that \(R_{\rm C}\) must be considered when extracting \(\mu_{\rm FEi}\) in the fabricated ZnON TFT. The inset of Fig. 4(b) depicts the temperature dependence of \(R_{\rm C}\) extracted at various \(V_{\rm OV}\)s. \(R_{\rm C}\) decreases with an increase of temperature because the carriers more easily overcome the Schottky barrier between the AlN and ZnON at a higher temperature.

Fig. 5 depicts the \(V_{\rm OV}\) and temperature dependence of \(\mu_{\rm FEi}\) extracted by Eq. (3) from the fabricated ZnON TFT. In multi-cation amorphous oxide TFTs, including a-IGZO TFTs, the carrier transport has been mainly explained based on the trap-limited and percolation conduction mechanisms [24, 25, 26]. Fig. 5 shows that \(\mu_{\rm FEi}\) decreases with an increase in \(V_{\rm OV}\) and temperature. Because \(\mu_{\rm FEi}\) increases with \(V_{\rm OV}\) and temperature when it is determined by trap-limited or percolation conduction mechanisms [27], the experimental results in Fig. 5 show that the carrier transport in the ZnON TFT in the above-threshold region is predominantly not governed by these mechanisms. The unavailability of the percolation conduction mechanism in explaining the carrier transport in the ZnON TFT is physically acceptable because the ZnON is free from the potential fluctuation in the conduction band minima resulting from the interactions of multiple cations [5]. The decrease of \(\mu_{\rm FEi}\) with an increase in \(V_{\rm OV}\) and temperature is observed when \(\mu_{\rm FEi}\) is limited by the phonon scattering [28]. The decrease of \(\mu_{\rm FEi}\) with an increase in \(V_{\rm OV}\) is also observed when the carrier transport is limited by the surface roughness scattering. However, the effects of temperature on the surface roughness scattering are known to be negligible [28]. The phonon scattering is the representative scattering mechanism governing the band transport of carriers, and has been considered as the dominant mechanism limiting the mobility in the single crystalline metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor [29] and the multilayer molybdenum disulfide transistor [30]. Based on the experimental results in Fig. 5, the phonon scattering is believed to be the most probable mechanism limiting \(\mu_{\rm FEi}\) in the fabricated high-mobility ZnON TFT in the above-threshold region.

## IV Conclusion

In this letter, the gate bias and temperature dependence of the conductance and \(\mu_{\rm FEi}\) were analyzed to investigate the carrier transport mechanism in the ZnON TFT. In the subthreshold region, \(V_{\rm on}\) moves in the negative direction and \(SS\) continuously increases with an increase of temperature. The measured bias-temperature dependence of the conductance is well explained by the MN rule, which suggests that the dominant carrier transport mechanism in the ZnON TFT in the subthreshold region is the trap-limited conduction caused by the multiple trapping and thermal release events associated with the localized tail states. The carrier transport mechanism in the ZnON TFT in the above-threshold region was investigated by observing the bias-temperature dependence of \(\mu_{\rm FEi}\). \(\mu_{\rm FEi}\)s were extracted by excluding the contact resistance effects using the transmission line method. According to the results, \(\mu_{\rm FEi}\) decreases with an increase in \(V_{\rm OV}\) and temperature, which suggests that the carrier transport is mainly limited by the phonon scattering in the ZnON TFT in the above-threshold region.
