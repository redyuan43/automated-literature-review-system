## I Introduction

The formation of ohmic contacts on n-type or p-type GaN is very important for the fabrication of efficient electronic and optoelectronic devices such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs), laser diodes, solar cells, and heterostructure field-effect transistors [1, 2]. In particular, ohmic contact to p-GaN is a critical issue since Schottky theory predicts that the formation of low-resistance contacts is difficult due to the extremely large Schottky barrier height formed at metal/p-GaN interfaces [3]. In addition, the large activation energy required for Mg doping also prevents the generation of degenerate semiconductors [4], which would enhance the tunneling transport at metal/p-GaN interfaces and, hence, ohmic formation. Faced with these problems, a number of research groups have investigated possible solutions [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. Chemical treatment of the p-GaN surface could effectively remove surface oxides and could form Ga vacancies \(V_{\rm Ga}\) acting as acceptors, thus resulting in ohmic contact [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. The appropriate use of heterostructures on p-GaN was found to control the surface polarization field, leading to an accumulation of charge carriers near the metal contact and, hence, ohmic formation via tunneling [12, 13, 14, 15]. Excessive Mg doping was also found to effectively reduce contact resistance by forming a Mg-related deep-level defect (DLD) band, which acts as an effective carrier pathway at the metal/p-GaN interface [16, 17, 18]. Currently, excessive Mg doping is widely used in the field of GaN-based semiconductors since it has good reproducibility, process simplicity, and excellent contact properties. Recently, we have investigated the carrier transport mechanism and the effective barrier height for Ni/Ag/Pt contacts to highly Mg-doped p-GaN using the DLD band model [18]. However, systematic studies of the effect of Mg doping concentration on the carrier transport mechanism are still necessary.

In this paper, we investigated the carrier transport mechanism of Ni/Ag/Pt contacts to moderately Mg-doped p-GaN (referred here as "sample A") and highly Mg-doped p-type GaN ("sample B"). It was shown that the ohmic behavior and the predominant carrier transport mechanism were quite different depending on the Mg-doping concentration, i.e., carrier transport occurred through thermionic field emission (TFE) for sample A and through the DLD band for sample B. The ohmic mechanism is discussed based on analytical calculations of contact parameters, including the Schottky barrier height, tunneling parameters, and the effective barrier height associated with the DLD band.

## II Experimental Procedures

The 0.8-\(\mu\)m-thick moderately doped p-GaN (sample A) was grown on sapphire substrates using a metal-organic chemical vapor deposition system. The highly Mg-doped p-GaN (sample B) was obtained from commercially available LED wafers, i.e., the top layer of the LED wafers was used for contact studies. Table I summarizes the electrical and structural properties of samples A and B, in which the Mg doping concentration ([Mg]) was measured using secondary ion mass spectroscopy. Hall effect measurements were also performed to obtain carrier concentration \(N\) and Hall mobility \(\mu_{\rm Hall}\). Sample A was found to have good electrical properties, i.e., \(N=\) 9.0 \(\times\) 10\({}^{17}\) cm\({}^{-3}\) and \(\mu_{\rm Hall}=\) 7.8 cm\({}^{2}\)/Vs. The carrier concentration and Hall mobility could not be measured for sample B due to data scattering caused by opposite conductive layers underneath the p-GaN. However, based on literature references [16], the carrier concentration of sample B could be roughly estimated as being on the order of \(\sim\)10\({}^{16}\) cm\({}^{-3}\). Contact behavior was evaluated using the transmission line model (TLM) method [3],where the pad geometry had a contact dimension of \(200\times 100\)\(\mu\)m\({}^{2}\) and a gap spacing of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 \(\mu\)m. As the contact metal, a Ni (2 mm)/Ag (100 nm)/Pt (10 nm) scheme was deposited on the TLM-patterned p-GaN using an e-beam evaporator, followed by rapid internal annealing at 500 \({}^{\circ}\)C for 1 min under ambient oxygen conditions. The Ni/Ag/Pt scheme was chosen due to its wide viability as a thermally stable reflective p-contact for high-power GaN-based LEDs [19]. The electrical characteristics of the contacts were measured using a parameter analyzer (HP4156A). To investigate the carrier transport mechanism, current-voltage-temperature (\(I\)\(-\)\(V\)\(-\)\(T\)) measurements were carried out in the temperature range from 200 K to 500 K.

## III Results and Discussion

Fig. 1 shows the \(I\)-\(V\) characteristics of Ni/Ag/Pt contacts on sample A obtained before and after thermal annealing, as measured from adjacent pads with a gap spacing of 5 \(\mu\)m. Note that the as-deposited Ni/Ag/Pt contact has a very poor \(I\)-\(V\) curve despite noble electrical properties of sample A with a relatively large hole concentration and high mobility. According to Schottky theory, this is due to the large Schottky barrier height \(q\Phi_{b}\) formed at the Ni/p-GaN interface, i.e., \(q\Phi_{b}=2.35\) eV, as obtained from the difference of the work function between Ni (5.15 eV) and p-GaN (7.5 eV). However, thermal annealing led to a significant improvement in the \(I\)-\(V\) curve, although the \(I\)-\(V\) curve was slightly nonlinear. This can be attributed to the distinctive nature of the Ag-based contact to p-GaN, i.e., the generation of interfacial Ga vacancies \(V_{\rm Ga}\) acting as acceptors as a result of the formation of Ag-Ga solid solution via thermal annealing [9, 10, 11], as will be discussed later.

To investigate contact properties, the total resistances \(R_{T}\) of annealed Ni/Ag/Pt contacts to sample A, which could be calculated from the measured current at 0.1 V, i.e., \(R_{T}=V/I\), were plotted, as shown in Fig. 1(b). Based on the systematic spacing dependence of the total resistances, contact parameters, including the specific contact resistance \(\rho_{\rm sc}\) and the sheet resistance of the p-GaN \(R_{\rm sh}\), could be obtained according to following equation [3]:

\[R_{T}=\frac{R_{\rm sh}}{Z}(d+2L_{T}) \tag{1}\]

where \(Z\) is the contact width (200 \(\mu\)m) and \(L_{T}\) is the transfer length with a relation of \(L_{T}=(\rho_{\rm sc}/R_{\rm sh})^{1/2}\). Consequently, a linear regression fit of \(R_{T}\) versus \(d\) data yielded \(\rho_{\rm sc}=7.1\times 10^{-2}\)\(\Omega\)cm\({}^{2}\) and \(R_{\rm sh}=8610\)\(\Omega\)/\(\square\) for sample A.

To understand the carrier transport mechanism of sample A, \(I\)\(-\)\(V\)\(-\)\(T\) measurements were performed, as shown in Fig. 2, it is worth noting that the \(I\)\(-\)\(V\)\(-\)\(T\) measurements were performed for annealed samples only since they showed an ohmic

behavior, which is essential to accurately obtain the contact properties using the TLM method. It is shown that \(I-V\) curves improve with temperatures, which is intrinsically associated with either an increase in charge carriers in p-GaN or enhanced carrier transport at the metal/p-GaN interface.

Fig. 3 shows the temperature-dependent specific contact resistances of sample A. It is shown that the specific contact resistances gradually decreased with increasing temperature. In principle, to understand the carrier transport mechanism, it is important to use an appropriate conduction model [3, 20, 21], i.e., thermionic emission (TE), TFE, and field emission (FE). For example, TE dominates when \(E_{00}/kT\leq\) 0.5, TFE dominates when 0.5 \(<E_{00}/kT<\) 5, and FE dominates when \(E_{00}/kT\geq\) 5, where \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant and \(E_{00}\) is the tunneling parameter, which is given by \(E_{00}=(qh/4\pi)[N/(m^{*}\varepsilon_{s})]^{1/2}\), where \(q\) is the electronic charge, \(h\) is Planck's constant, \(m^{*}\) is the effective hole mass, and \(\varepsilon_{s}\) is the dielectric constant of GaN. For sample A, the \(E_{00}/kT\) value was calculated to be as low as 0.25, which lies in the TE regime. The specific contact resistance under TE conduction is thereby given by [20, 21]

\[\rho_{\rm sc}=\frac{k}{qA^{**}T}\exp\left(\frac{q\Phi_{b}}{kT}\right)\ \mbox{for TE} \tag{2}\]

where \(A^{**}\) is the Richardson constant. Using the theoretical \(A^{**}\) value of 103.8 Acm\({}^{-2}\)K\({}^{-2}\) and \(q\Phi_{b}\) values in a range of 0.3-0.7 eV, theoretical \(\rho_{\rm sc}\) versus \(T\) curves were plotted, as shown in Fig. 3 (see the dashed line). Of note, the theoretical \(\rho_{\rm sc}\) versus \(T\) curves did not agree with the experimental data. For example, the theoretical curve from the TE model showed a rapid drop in \(\rho_{\rm sc}\) with increasing \(T\), whereas the experimental data (solid dots) had less sensitive temperature dependence. This indicates that the TE model was not appropriate for explaining the carrier transport of sample A.

If both the Richardson constant and Schottky barrier height were set as variable parameters, a better theoretical fitting of the experimental data using (2) could be performed, as shown by the solid line in Fig. 3 with \(q\Phi_{b}=\) 0.039 eV and \(A^{**}=\) 2.0 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-5}\) Acm\({}^{-2}\)K\({}^{-2}\). However, these results were also anomalous since the Schottky barrier height was much smaller than the expected value (\(\sim\)2.35 eV). Consistently, the Richardson constant was also much smaller than the theoretical value of 103.8 Acm\({}^{-2}\)K\({}^{-2}\) or the experimentally obtained value of 12 Acm\({}^{-2}\)K\({}^{-2}\)[21], which indicated that TE conduction was not appropriate for explaining the carrier transport in sample A.

A clue to elucidation of the carrier transport mechanism could be found from the electrical resistivity of p-GaN, as shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4 shows a semilogarithmic plot of the electrical resistivity of p-GaN \(\rho_{p}\) for sample A as a function of the inverse of the temperature. For comparison, the electrical resistivity of sample B was also plotted, as shown in the inset in Fig. 4. Note that the semilogarithmic \(\rho_{p}\) of sample A follows the Arrhenius plots reasonably well, whereas the Arrhenius plots of \(\rho_{p}\) for sample B show a significant deviation from straight lines, particularly at \(\leq\)300 K (as will be discussed later), indicating that band conduction is dominant in sample A, i.e., [22]

\[\rho_{p}=C_{\rho}\exp\left(\frac{E_{\rho}}{T}\right) \tag{3}\]

where \(C_{\rho}\) is the temperature-independent constant and \(E_{\rho}\) is the activation energy. Band conduction indicates that the carrier transport at the metal/p-GaN interface should follow Schottky theory, i.e., the carriers should overcome the Schottky barrier formed at the metal/p-GaN interface. However, it should be noted that the Schottky theory based on the TE model failed to explain the contact behavior, as shown in Fig. 3. To address this argument, it is important to remind the mechanism of Ag-based ohmic contact to p-GaN upon thermal annealing. For example, it was shown that the generation of interfacial \(V_{\rm Ga}\) was the key ohmic mechanism upon thermal annealing caused by the formation of Ag-Ga solid solution [9, 10, 11]. In this case, increased interfacial carriers may alter the dominant carrier transport mechanism from TE to TFE, i.e., [20, 21]

\[\rho_{\rm sc}=\frac{\coth^{1/2}(E_{00}/kT)\cosh(E_{00}/kT)}{(qA^{ **}/k^{2})\left[\pi E_{00}q(\Phi_{b}+V_{p})\right]^{1/2}}\\ \times\exp\left[\frac{q(\Phi_{b}+V_{p})}{E_{00}\coth(E_{00}/kT)} -\frac{qV_{p}}{kT}\right]\ \mbox{for TFE} \tag{4}\]

where \(V_{p}\) is the energy difference between Fermi level \(E_{F}\) and valence band \(E_{V}\).

Fig. 5 shows the experimental \(\rho_{\rm sc}\) data fitted with (4), where the theoretical Richardson constant was used in this calculation. Agreement was observed between the experimental and theoretical data, indicating that the use of the TFE model was reasonable. The extracted Schottky barrier height was \(q\Phi_{b}=0.94\) eV, and the tunneling parameter was \(E_{00}=0.045\) eV. Based on the \(E_{00}\) value, the carrier concentration could be calculated to be \(4.5\times 10^{19}\) cm\({}^{-3}\). The obtained carrier concentration was much higher than the initial hole concentration (\(9.0\times 10^{17}\) cm\({}^{-3}\)). This result predicts that the concentration of generated Ga vacancies \(V_{\rm Ga}\) would be approximately \(4.4\times 10^{19}\) cm\({}^{-3}\). Consequently, although the Schottky barrier height was as large as 0.94 eV, a thin barrier with a depletion width \(W\) of 4.8 nm was expected to form, as described in the inset in Fig. 5, in which the barrier width was calculated based on the depletion-region width, i.e., \(W=[(2\varepsilon_{s}/N)(\Phi_{b}-V_{p})]^{1/2}\). Therefore, the ohmic behavior of sample A could be understood via field emission through thin barriers.

For highly Mg-doped sample B, an excellent ohmic contact with the specific contact resistance of \(7.0\times 10^{-4}\)\(\Omega\)cm\({}^{2}\) could be obtained, as reported earlier [18]. The ohmic mechanism, however, could not be simply explained in terms of the TFE model as such in sample A since the electrical resistivity of sample B showed a deviation from the Arrhenius behavior, as shown in the inset in Fig. 4. Alternatively, the semilogarithmic \(\rho_{p}\) of sample B followed \(\sim\)\(T^{-1/4}\) across the entire temperature range, indicating that the dominant carrier transport in highly Mg-doped p-GaN occurred not by band conduction but by so-called variable-range hopping (VRH) conduction through the Mg-related DLD band [17, 23]. In this case, the ohmic mechanism could be explained in terms of carrier transport through the Mg-related DLD band, in which effective barrier height \(q\varphi\), which was defined as the barrier for hole carriers residing from the completely occupied DLD band to overcome to move into the metal, was considered as the key contact parameter. Indeed, effective barrier height \(q\varphi\) was obtained to be 0.12 eV, which was low enough to explain the formation of excellent ohmic contact.

So far, different carrier transport mechanisms were proposed depending on the Mg doping concentration, i.e., TFE for moderately doped p-GaN (sample A) and the DLD band model for highly doped p-GaN (sample B). For sample A, the dominant carrier transport by TFE was due to the generation of Ga vacancies as a result of a thermodynamic reaction between Ni/Ag/Pt and p-GaN. However, carrier transport involving the DLD band at the metal/p-GaN interface appears not to be valid since VRH conduction was not observed for sample A, as shown in Fig. 4. This suggests that, due to the relatively low [Mg], Mg-related deep-level states were insufficient to form a DLD band to act as an effective pathway for carrier transport. Specifically, it is important to note that the [Mg] is closely related to the average distance of neighboring deep-level states, i.e., the probability of hopping [24].

For sample B, since the same metal scheme and annealing process were used, the generation of Ga vacancies, i.e., TFE conduction, was also expected to have a strong influence on the contact mechanism. In other words, a combination of the DLD-associated transport model and TFE would be most reasonable for the carrier transport mechanism of sample B. This study is currently under investigation.

## IV Summary

The carrier transport mechanism of Ni/Ag/Pt contacts to Mg-doped p-type GaN has been investigated. The contact behavior was found to strongly depend on the Mg doping concentration. For the moderately doped p-GaN, the as-deposited Ni/Ag/Pt contacts showed a rectifying behavior, whereas thermal annealing performed at 500 \({}^{\circ}\)C for 1 min under ambient oxygen conditions yielded a near-ohmic behavior with a specific contact resistance of \(7.1\times 10^{-2}\)\(\Omega\)cm\({}^{2}\). This result could be explained in terms of Schottky theory with TFE, in which the Schottky barrier height obtained from \(I\)\(-\)\(V\)\(-\)\(T\) measurements was as high as 0.94 eV and the carrier concentration was \(4.5\times 10^{19}\) cm\({}^{-3}\). For the highly Mg-doped p-GaN, the excellent ohmic contact with a specific contact resistance of \(7.0\times 10^{-4}\)\(\Omega\)cm\({}^{2}\) could be obtained upon thermal annealing. Notably, \(I\)\(-\)\(V\)\(-\)\(T\) measurements revealed that the electrical resistivity of p-GaN follows \(\sim\)\(T^{-1/4}\), indicating that the dominant carrier transport was via VRH conduction through Mg-related DLDs. Based on this DLD-associated model, the effective barrier height at the metal/p-GaN interface as low as 0.12 eV could be obtained, which was consistent with the formation of excellent ohmic contact.
