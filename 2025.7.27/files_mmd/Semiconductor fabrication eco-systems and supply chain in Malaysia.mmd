The electronic industry is the leading sector in Malaysia's manufacturing sector, contributing significantly to the country's manufacturing output 29.3%, export 55.9% and employment of 28.8%. In 70's Malaysia is well known for the backend manufacturing. In 2000 Malaysia established it's semiconductor fabrication facilities to fill in one of the major gaps in supply chain that generates RM0.5Billion/year from a single facility. This significant source of revenue gives major impact to the overall semiconductor eco-system and local economy. Semiconductor fabrication requires huge equipment investment using various types of chemicals, gasses, materials, software systems, automation, jigs and fixtures, consumables and parts in clean room environment. The process to fabricate a chip on wafer will take thirty to one hundred days depending on the complexity of the design. This demands a very highly skilled workforce to operate the processes, equipments, manufacturing and facilities. Semiconductor fabrication facility has a very deep anchor to the value chain surrounding economy and will be discussed in detail the presentation.
