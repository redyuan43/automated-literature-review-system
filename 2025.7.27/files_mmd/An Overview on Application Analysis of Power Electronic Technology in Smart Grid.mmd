## 1 Introduction

Electricity as a kind of energy in people's daily life and national economic production in various fields has occupied an increasingly important position. In the rapid economic growth since the reform and opening up behind, electricity consumption is also constantly increasing, the grid architecture complex, power shortage, effects of haze, fossil energy scarcity and other issues have become increasingly prominent, the development of the electric power system is facing the hitherto unknown challenge. Smart grid is the implementation of digital transmission substation data by using modern sensing and measurement technology, and the use of modern communications technology and computer technology in relay protection, the new power grid, is the modern information technology, communication technology, measurement sensor technology, control technology, computer technology, power electronics technology and equipment manufacturing technology as the foundation, is safe, economical and clean, flexible and compatible interaction characteristic of a new type of power grid[1-2]. Smart grid has relative real-time, on-line and continuous safety assessment and analysis capabilities with the traditional grid, early warning and preventive control ability strong, and the ability of automatic fault diagnosis, fault isolation and self recovery system. The utility system has the characteristics of reliability, practicability, environmental protection and energy saving, and can effectively improve the operation efficiency of the electric power system.

In the electric power system and the development of intelligent power grid, power generation, renewable energy storage unit conversion, AC / DC power grid interconnection, the flexible electric two-way flow, the harmonics and reactive power dynamic compensation depends on the power electronic devices[3-4]. Thanks to the development of high voltage and high power electronic devices, converter unit modular and intelligent control strategy to enhance the level of progress, power electronic devices will play a greater role in the power system. Especially in recent years with the global demand of power electronic devices, such as high-voltage inverter, power quality control, large airborne traction, wind power and photovoltaic power generation, distributed independent power system, large smelting, plasma discharge pulse power device, power electronics technology has become the field of smart grid the most popular problem.

## 2 Power Electronic Technology

Electronic power technology is a new technology in the field of power electronics. It is a technology that uses power electronic devices to control and convert electrical power. Manufacturing technology of power electronic technology, power electronic devices and converter technology two branch, power electronic technology used in the smart grid is converter technology, so the power electronic technology in power system also has a role can not be ignored. The development of power electronics technology has penetrated into many fields, which shows the role of power electronics are not to be ignored in any field, the use of power electronics technology can make use of electrical energy to a reasonable state, optimize energy use, and also play an important role in the construction of the transformation of traditional industries and the development of mechanical and electrical integration, intelligent development of power electronic technology for information processing and power processing brings new ways of connecting major reform, the development of power electronic technology will bring electronic technology[5].

In the power electronic technology, there are three important components, namely, power electronic devices, power electronic circuits and power electronic converter main circuit. The first part of the power electronic devices, as an electronic operating device, it is responsible for the control of the power of change. Accordingto the control situation is divided into three categories, for during the semi controlled crystal gate tube with air type devices, the need for current driving and driving voltage is full controlled devices, and one can improve the safety of the device type is not controllable. The second is the overall control of power electronic circuits, as an important part of power electronic technology, the control of power electronic circuits is very important. In order to be able to effectively ensure the adequacy of energy, it is through the power semiconductor devices to transform and control the power. Because only through the weak signal to control the power, power semiconductor devices, once the problem, you can not control the circuit. The last part is the main circuit of the power electronic converter, which is mainly responsible for the change and control of electric power. The power semiconductor devices play a very important role, and it is not through the same circuit topology and control methods to achieve high frequency, high frequency, high power factor and low conversion loss. The active and passive power semiconductor devices are arranged in order to form the topology structure of the main circuit of the converter. For the power electronic technology, these three parts are indispensable. And power electronic technology, including high voltage DC transmission technology, flexible AC transmission technology, intelligent switch technology and high voltage frequency conversion technology, etc..

## 3 The Importance of Power Electronic Technology in Smart Grid

Smart grid is not a one-way system, it should be based on user needs and changes in the environment to make the corresponding change, otherwise it does not meet the requirements of the outside world. Therefore, in order to adapt to this change, it is needed to take some effective measures and means. After years of development of power electronic technology, has achieved good results in all aspects of the power grid, so that the power grid transmission and distribution capacity, power quality and other aspects of the power grid have varying degrees of change. Because of the grid structure of China's power grid is not perfect, so, all aspects of the power grid will be different degrees of problems. In order to change this situation, to achieve a strong power grid structure, it is necessary to apply power electronic technology, so that it can play a role in the transmission, distribution and other aspects of. In the future development, the development of smart grid speed will be faster and faster, the power grid structure will become increasingly strong, however, by the external interference factors will be more and more. How to take an effective measure to control it, to ensure its safe and reliable operation has become a real problem. The power electronic technology, with its unique advantages, can be used as a kind of system regulation and control method in the smart grid[6].

In today's rapid growth of electricity, in terms of power safety measures are relatively weak. In order to meet the needs of the general society for electricity, the power sector must establish a high level of security and a new team of large hybrid power network system. In this system, the controlled series compensation and reactive power compensation are used to ensure the security and stability of the smart grid. In the intelligent circuit, we must set up the safety precautions to ensure that the safety trigger can be sensitive to the work. The actual trigger for the series there will be relative risk in some operating mode, and related equipment involved in the safety measures of failure if not timely discharge is likely to cause significant security risks of failure in the application process in the long time. The application of power electronic technology in power system has made great progress, but at this stage, there is no perfect reliability and economic evaluation system for large scale application of power electronic devices. It becomes an urgent problem to evaluate the adaptability of power grid and the economic benefit brought by power electronic devices in large scale application of power electronic devices. Safe use of power electronic technology is an important topic of the smart grid, because of the wide use of power electronic converter technology, so the system has occurred in the harmonic instability and synchronous motor self-excited vibration or subsynchronous resonance, which is the key problem of power electronics and HVDC system is one of the domestic has also started the related research work[7]. In addition, the shortcomings of the current development of simulation technology also limits the power electronic technology, power electronic simulation platform must establish a unified, deep mining characteristics of power electronic devices in the power grid, reliability of power electronic device, improve the reliability of power system.

The grid structure of power grid in China is relatively weak, there are still many places need to adjust and upgrade in power transmission, distribution and other fields, to increase research and development efforts of flexible AC transmission system, strengthen the power grid structure. From the perspective of the development of the world's power grid, the interconnection of large power grid is the inevitable trend of the development of the future power grid. Large AC / DC power system structure of our country is becoming more and more complicated, the operation control is also gradually increase, in addition, in extreme natural disasters, extreme external disaster events will cause catastrophic damage to the safe and reliable operation of large power grid. In this case, the advanced power electronic devices as the important means of regulation, the distribution of power flow can be used to regulate the transmission and distribution network, enhance the network structure, to suppress the spread of power failures, and improve the power grid under various fault self-healing ability, so as to improve the operation level of the security and stability of power grid in China, better economic and social support the development[8].

Distribution of low ability in our country in many backward areas exist in smart grid resource optimization, energy distribution are greatly uneven, on the whole, there are large-scale coal-fired power resources in the West and north of China, and in the East and south there are many hydraulic power resources, in order to achieve rational allocation of resources in China the east of West Transportation and coal resources of water conservancy and electric power, and in the process of resource allocation, there are large scale, long distance transportation and transmission technology are low and so on a series of problems in the power transmission process, due to transportation line resistance exists resulting in a large number of energy loss is strict, we can see that the current grid has been difficult in the coordination of energy and industrial countries to adapt to the requirements of the development.

## 4 Application of Power Electronic Technology in Smart Grid

Power electronic technology is divided into high voltage DC power transmission technology, flexible communication technology, intelligent switch technology, high voltage frequency conversion technology and demand side technology, etc.. The previous technology needs to change a large range of equipment, in order to achieve power grid distribution functions. With the development and progress of technology, the flexible AC transmission technology has been updated. China's energy distribution is not balanced, has been a factor affecting the use of energy. But flexible transmission technology can be a good solution to this problem, which is very favorable for the development of smart grid.

### Hydc

In our country, at present, the direct current transmission system is mainly in the transmission link, while the power generation and the power system used in the electric power system are still. The alternating current in the transmission line is conveyed to the rectifier equipment through the converter transformer equipment at the power supply side, and the AC is converted to a high voltage direct current and then transported to the DC transmission line. And then through the DC/DC transmission line from the inverter to flow back to the terminal equipment in converter station. The high voltage direct current is converted into alternating current, and the current of the converter transformer is transported to the AC system. HVDC project basic topology of converter station is shown in figure 1.

At present, China's smart grid is generally in UHV transmission system as the foundation, therefore, must be considered in isolation and intervention between the new energy and clean energy, this is also the main reason for promoting the development of flexible AC transmission technology. In the flexible AC transmission system of our country, the converter equipment is used in the way of the self exchange, which is controlled independently. These advantages are used in some more remote areas, and play a positive role. Flexible ac electrical wiring diagram is shown in figure 2. Through the good integration of flexible AC technology and modern control technology, smart grid in China has been able to complete all kinds of electric power parameters adjustment and control, not only reduces the power loss in power transmission, the transmission capability of protecting the security and stability.

### Intelligent switch technology

In the power electronic technology, the application of intelligent switch technology is very important. Because of its combination with sensing technology and computer technology, micro electronic technology can avoid the problems in the field of intelligent power grid, electric shock and so on, to protect the security and reliability of the smart grid. As an important component of the intelligent switch is the total power switch and the various sub switches, so the main protective effect is the main power switch. Intelligent switch technology is adopted in the current or voltage of the specified phase to open or close circuit to reduce the loss of electrical equipment and instruments. For example, through the closure of the switch can avoid the problems of household appliances and other electrical equipment, in the future power grid construction, intelligent switch technology will also change, to achieve the goal of intelligent.

Generally speaking, the intelligent switch is mainly composed of the main power switch, the switch and the shell. The power switch is mainly to protect the overvoltage and overcurrent total effect; and the switch adopts the integral structure type, also has the protection function, prevent over-current or leakage phenomenon, protect the user terminal electrical safety equipment. Diode-camped multi-level converter and Capacitance floating multi-level converter is shown in figure 3. With the continuous development of smart grid, and achieved certain results in the development of related equipment, switch equipment with high quality and high performance has been derived, along with the development of computer technology, power electronics technology, these devices also gradually to the intelligent development.

### High voltage frequency conversion technology

To meet the purpose of the node, came into being the high voltage frequency conversion technology, this technology is the biggest advantage of power, its power saving rate can reach about 30%, but its cost is high, easy to cause high harmonic pollution. At present, the application of high voltage frequency conversion technology in smart grid, energy saving effect is remarkable, is the choice of many industrial production enterprises, the use of high voltage slope technology greatly reduces the cost of electricity. Domestic high voltage inverter is the main power of multilevel technology to achieve energy saving, this device has a process of high density, compact structure and flexible control advantages, I believe the future will be applied to more areas.

### Demand side technology

Demand side technology is mainly based on the user power reliability and quality requirements, or use some of the power supply and has the special requirements of users, combination of power electronic technology and distribution automation technology, so as to provide power supply for more in line with the user. In the face of the increasingly grim situation of power load and power quality, power enterprises should not only satisfy the power supply demand more and more, but also in response to energy saving call to action, on their own technology need to improve. Demand side technology is to ensure clean energy and new energy grid, and to solve the problem of fault current limit protection and put forward new ideas and methods.
