# Range Extension and Channel Capacity

Increase in Direct Short Range Vehicular UWB Communications

###### Abstract

Direct short range broadband communication access in vehicles promises to deliver high quality of service IP-based communications with networks deployed in moving vehicles. This paper provides an analysis of range extension and channel capacity increase in such networks when multi-hop communication is adopted for ultra wideband (UWB) communications. Received signal to noise ratio is used with multi-hopping to analyse range extension. Since the received signal levels for each short hop is higher compared with longer hops, the Shannon channel capacity for the short hops are equally higher leading to increased total channel capacity in multi-hop situations. Therefore cheaper and low powered transmitters can be used in the multi-hop scenario. The smaller transceivers also produce less interferences compared to the larger transceivers although it remains to be demonstrated if the total sum of the interference generated by the smaller transmitters is of the same order as that generated by the fewer but bigger transceivers.

## 1 Introduction

The promise of broadband wireless communications can be enhanced by the application of ultra wideband over short distances using low powered transceivers provided the interference levels that are admissible are achieved. Recently several authors have demonstrated some of the advantages of short range relay communications using UWB. Conventionally, a repeater on a high rise tower or hill provides the means for range extension The cheapest approach using conventional repeaters to extend the range of UWB communications has several flaws. If the repeater employs the same frequency as in its received signal for relaying, co-channel interference results and limits the system capacity. The repeater may also change the carrier frequency of the received signal before transmitting to avoid co-channel interference. However, the large UWB bandwidth (3.1 GHz to 10.6 GHz) means that even if it is used as a single broadband or divided into sub-carrier bands, it requires effort to change the carrier frequencies. In [1] a pulse position modulation (PPM) repeater is described. The repeater simply receives the signal, amplifies it and transmits it to the intended destination. Since the relayed signal is at the same carrier frequency as the input to the repeater, co-channel interference results. To obviate this problem the authors introduced a delayed-repeater in which a time delay is deliberately introduced to help the separation of the signals. This approach leads to degraded bit error rate (BER) performance due to multipath.

The 802.15.3 standard includes a coverage extension mechanism by creating neighbour piconts from a parentpiconet. Unfortunately although the air interface (multi-band OFDM) used by the system has multi-channel capability to permit frequency re-use, this advantage was not taken. Hence the child picocnet operates at the same frequency as the parent picocnet. This reduces the achievable capacity compared with if frequency re-use were adopted. To solve this problem [2] introduced a dedicate range extension device that is operated in a mesh network architecture. The device acts as the coordinator of the picocnet and provides timing and media access control mechanisms. The remaining devices in the picocnet experience co-channel interference and the achievable system capacity is degraded. Furthermore, if the nodes in the picocnets are mobile, network segmentation can result under certain mobility situations.

Range extension can lead to enhanced network connectivity and capacity increases in mobile ad hoc networks if gateways are appropriately located. This is illustrated in [3] by proposing range extension using mobile gateways and in [4] positioned unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), geosynchronous and/or low-earth orbiting satellites (LEO) which maintain communication links with mobile gateways in difficult terrains. The approach reduces network segmentation in difficult terrains and has military applications and communication in disaster zones. Determining the locations of range extension gateways adds to the complexity of the problem, however, 10% - 15% improvement in the throughput and latency of the system was achieved. Therefore, range extension methods may employ either land-based or space deployed relay nodes. By considering the network elements to consist of a layer of the network and the range extension devices (gateways and relays) as a second layer, an inter-working device the so-called cross-layer communication agent (CCA) was introduced and described in [4]. The problem in [4] is to correctly position the CCA for optimum connectivity and communication throughput. In [5] Pabst et al showed that relaying can lead to reduction infrastructure deployment costs and by exploiting spatial diversity, multihop relaying can lead to increased system capacity. While the work in [5] focused on fixed nodes, it was proposed that the methods overviewed apply to mobile nodes. However one question remains, how much specifically is the capacity increase due to range extension and relaying. We seek to provide an answer and an estimate of the increased capacity in this paper.

Recently Levit derived the theoretical range limitation of ultra wideband communications [6] starting from the Shannon information expression. This led to the fundamental limitation of the data rate given as a function of range R as follows:

\[M=B\log_{2}\left(\mathbb{I}+\left(\mathbb{I}.687\bullet 10^{12}/B\bullet R^{2} \right)\right) \tag{1}\]

From (1) the UWB channel capacity falls off rapidly with distance if more power is not used in the transmitter. However using a high transmit power for ultra wideband communication creates more interference to other communication systems using adjacent channels. Therefore, using more power at the transmitter is not the best approach to increase transmission range. The capacity also falls off with reduced channel bandwidth B which also is undesirable. The positive inference from equation (1) is that significant broadband direct short range communication can be achieved without using extraordinarily high transmission power. For example if B=20MHz and R=20m, then M=154.54Mbps over this short distance - a result that is highly significant for vehicular communications along urban roads and highways. We can achieve a higher capacity using relay-based communications.

Recently,relay-node-based communication using hopping has been shown to be a suitable means of achieving greater range or higher coverage with equivalent signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Relay node communications have been proposed as a means of extending the range of W-CDMA high speed downlink packet access (HSDPA) systems [6-8]. The technique breaks up the direct link distance into smaller distances where relay nodes are placed for hopping so that smaller transmission powers are used at the intermediate nodes and still achieve the same SNR at the distant receiver. For UWB communications, this is very useful as it suggests that both range extension and broadband channel capacity enhancements can be achieved using relay node communications placed at shorter UWB coverage distances. In this manuscript we demonstrate that relay nodes are effective in increasing the channel capacity of UWB communication systems. Range extension with relay nodes is analysed first.

## 2 Relay Node Communications

Relay node communication uses network nodes that have wireless links between them (Figure 1) and each node forwards or relays the information to its neighbour until it reaches the intended destination. Relay communication is seen as a means for conserving power with smaller transceivers, increase frequency re-use and reduce interference. Range extension and capacity increases of such communication are considered in this section. The issue of frequency re-use is the subject of another communication.

Given two nodes linked directly with a radio frequency link, the path loss in dB is:

\[L_{d}\left(\textit{dB}\right)=\textit{b}_{d}+10\,\gamma\,\text{log}\,\,\textit{ s}_{d} \tag{2}\]

where, \(\textit{b}_{d}\) (in decibels) is the loss at the intercept point [7], \(\gamma\) is the path loss exponent and the separation between the nodes in metres is \(S_{d}\). The raw value of the path loss is:

\[L_{d}=10^{\frac{\textit{b}_{d}}{10}}\,\textit{s}_{d}^{\gamma} \tag{3}\]

The total path loss between the source and destination when N relaying nodes are used is given by the expression

\[L_{r}=\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}10^{\frac{\textit{b}_{i}}{10}}\,\textit{s}_{i}^{\gamma_{ i}} \tag{4}\]

or relays the information to its neighbour until it reaches the intended destination. Relay communication is seen as a means for conserving power with smaller transceivers, increase frequency re-use and reduce interference. Range extension and capacity increases of such communication are considered in this section. The issue of frequency re-use is the subject of another communication.

Given two nodes linked directly with a radio frequency link, the path loss in dB is:

\[L_{d}\left(\textit{dB}\right)=\textit{b}_{d}+10\,\gamma\,\text{log}\,\,\textit {s}_{d} \tag{2}\]

where, \(\textit{b}_{i}\) is the intercept point for the relay link segment i, \(\gamma_{i}\) is the path loss exponent for the ith hop and the separation between two neighbouring relay nodes (i-1 and i) is \(\textbf{s}_{i}\) such that the following inequality holds: \(\sum_{i}S_{i}\geq S_{d}\).

The gain achieved by relay communication (or multi-hop gain) \(\textit{G}_{m}\) is given by the ratio of the power transmitted directly between the source and destination and the sum of the power used in the relay nodes with the assumption that the signal to noise ratio seen at the receiver is the same (in both cases). This gain is given by the expression:

Figure 1: Hop Communication Between Receiving Stations

\[G_{m}=\frac{P_{d}}{\sum_{i}^{j}P_{i}}=\frac{L_{d}}{L_{r}} \tag{5}\]

This equation shows that it is possible to reduce the transmit power between two relay nodes by a factor \(G_{m}\) and still achieve the same SNR in the receiver or for the same transmit power between two relay nodes, the SNR seen at the receiver is \(G_{m}\) times. The effective range extension achieved is given as:

\[R_{ext}=\frac{S_{nt}}{S_{d}}=\frac{\left(G_{n}L_{d}\right/B_{d}\left.\right)_{r }^{\frac{1}{2}}}{\left(L_{d}\right/B_{d}\left.\right)_{r}^{\frac{1}{2}}}=\left( G_{n}\right)_{r}^{\frac{1}{2}} \tag{6}\]

Therefore the achievable distance with given SNR in the multi-hop communication is much longer than its single-hop version and given by \(S_{m}=R_{ext}S_{d}\).

### _Increase In Channel Capacity With Multi-Hopping_

The effect of multi-hopping on channel capacity can therefore also be estimated using equation (1). Let the total capacity of all the links in the relay path be given by the expression:

\[M_{r}=B\left[\sum_{i}\log_{i}(1+\left(1.687\bullet 10^{12}/B\bullet s_{i} ^{2}\right))\right] \tag{7}\]

The change in average channel capacity is given by the expression:

\[G_{c}=\frac{M_{r}}{M}=\frac{\sum_{i}\log_{i}(1+\left(1.687\bullet 10^{12}/B \bullet s_{i}^{2}\right))}{\log_{i}(1+\left(1.687\bullet 10^{12}/B\bullet R ^{2}\right))} \tag{8}\]

This is an increase in average channel capacity with multi-hop compared to the direct single-hop path between the transmitter and receiver. For example using the example where B=20MHz, R=1000m and S=100m, the capacity increase with multi-hop is \(G_{c}\)= 15.15 times the original capacity when the network did not use multi-hopping.

Consider for example a three-node relaying network (Figure 2) with channel bandwidth of 528 MHz in which the nodes are arranged to form the vertices of a right-angled triangle. Let the direct path be the path along its hypotenuse (TX-RX) and the relay path be TX-T-RX. It turns out that the gain in capacity by using the relay hop is 4.047.

## 3 Optimum Hop Distance

A relay network is typically an example of a chain network in which data is relayed across chains of transmitters until it reaches the destination. The neighbouring transmitters in a chain network [8] interfere with each other. The optimum separation between relaying nodes required to support a given level of signal to interference can be estimated by modifying the ideal equation (1). By aggregating the interference in a receiver as coming from its neighbouring (behind and in front) transmitters, the total path loss becomes:

\[L_{i}(dB)=b_{d}+10\gamma\log\left(k.s_{d}\right)+10\log(\sum_{i=0}^{+\infty} I^{r_{i}}) \tag{9}\]

The middle term uses an average path loss exponent in the chain. This equation assumes that the relaying nodes are equally separated from each other and k is the hop index. It also assumes that the interference comes from an infinite number of neighbouring transmitters. In practice none of these assumptions are true as the relay nodes are unlikely to be equally separated and the number of interfering sources is finite. It has been shown in [8] that the summation in equation (9) is convergent as long as the path loss exponent is negative and less

Figure 2: Relaying Communication

than unity \(\left(\gamma_{{}_{I}}<-1\right)\). The summation in (9) has no closed form if the path loss exponent is greater than unity. There is an upper bound on the summation [8] as

\[\sum_{I=1}^{+\infty}I^{{}_{I}}<\frac{\gamma_{{}_{I}}}{\gamma_{{}_{I}}+1},\ \ \ \left(\gamma_{{}_{I}}<-1\right) \tag{10}\]

The upper bound on the axial interference is given by the expression

\[L_{{}_{total}}(d\textbf{B})<b_{{}_{B}}+10\gamma\log\left(k\textbf{\emph{s}}_{{}_{ A}}\right)+10\log\left(\frac{\gamma_{{}_{I}}}{\gamma_{{}_{I}}+1}\right) \tag{11}\]

A node in a chain network normally experiences twice the level of interference caused by nodes in front and behind. Therefore the total axial loss has an additional factor of 3 dB and

\[L_{{}_{total}}=L_{{}_{axial}}+3d\textbf{B} \tag{11}\]

The total signal to interference ratio seen by a node is therefore given as:

\[SIR=P_{{}_{RX}}(D)-L_{{}_{total}}(d\textbf{B})>-10\gamma\log\left(k\right)-10 \gamma\log\left(k\right)-10\gamma\log\left(k\right)-10\gamma\log\left(k\right) -10\gamma\log\left(k\right)-10\gamma\log\left(k\right)-10\gamma\log\left(k \right)-10\gamma\log\left(k\right)-10\gamma\log\left(k\right)-10\gamma\log \left(k\right)-10\gamma\log\left(k\right)-10\gamma\log\left(k\right)-10\gamma \log\left(k\right)-10\gamma\log\left(k\right)-10\gamma\log\left(k\right)-10 \gammashort range vehicular communications using ultra wide band signals. We showed that it is better to use multi-hop communications with smaller transceivers using smaller transmission power and at shorter ranges. We have argued that the extra cost of having to deploy more transceivers is worth the benefit of broadband communications, particularly for vehicular networks in urban roads and highways. These benefits extend to direct short range communications to homes where the last metres to homes is covered with broadband wireless channels.
