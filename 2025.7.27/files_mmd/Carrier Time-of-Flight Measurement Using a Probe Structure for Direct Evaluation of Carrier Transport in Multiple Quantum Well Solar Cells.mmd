## I Introduction

Third-generation solar cells are proposed as a new concept of photovoltaic devices that have a potential to realize high energy conversion efficiency surpassing the detailed balance limit of conventional solar cells [1]. To realize such high efficiency, materials that can suppress carrier thermalization loss and subbandgap photon transmission loss are required. Quantum structures such as quantum wells [2, 3] and quantum dots [4, 5] tend to have properties of bandgap tunability, multienergy level, and slow carrier cooling, which satisfy the condition for suppressing the above-mentioned losses toward multijunction cell (using the first property) and single-junction cell (using the latter two properties) applications [6, 7].

Unlike bulk solar cells, physical dynamics in low-dimensional materials are complicated, and the behavior of cell performance is not easy to predict. This hinders us from systematically designing the quantum structures that provide the optimized cell performance. To gain insight into carrier dynamics in quantum structure solar cells, the behaviors of carriers after photogeneration including carrier thermalization [8, 9], recombination [11, 12, 13, 14], accumulation [15], and escape mechanisms [2, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20] have been widely discussed and studied for a few decades. Some research studies have used \(I\)-\(V\) characteristics or quantum efficiency [10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17] to verify the models, but these methods have a limitation in giving a clear picture of microscopic mechanisms. Measurement of continuous-wave photoluminescence (PL) can be used to directly observe the radiative recombination inside quantum structures [15, 18]. However, analysis using data from only emission intensity and wavelength hardly clarifies carriers. In contrast, a time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) technique provides real-time information and is widely employed for the investigation of the microscopic dynamics [9, 19, 20, 13]. Although TRPL can provide temporal information, it is not straightforward in obtaining spatial resolution. The reason is that quantum structures used in the solar cell application are typically the periodic stacks of unit structures, and thus, the observed TRPL is the superposition of the emission from each unit structure in different locations.

The authors have proposed a carrier time-of-flight (TOF) measurement technique to detect the accurate time taken by carriers to travel across quantum structures using a quantum-well probe with different emission wavelengths from the quantum structures [21]. This technique has confirmed that the drift transport can be investigated with higher sensitivity than the conventional TRPL technique. This is different from other carrier TOF techniques previously proposed in several studies [22, 23, 24, 25]. They similarly used quantum-well probes to detect carriers and estimate transport times, but they focused on the measurement of diffusion transport in flat or mostly flat band regions.

Observing drift transport, which is the dominant mechanism that drives carriers in quantum structure solar cells, will enhance our understandings of carrier dynamics in operating solar cells.

In this study, we focus on the evaluation of strain-balanced InGaAs/GaAsP multiple quantum well (MQW) structures. They consist of narrow-gap large-lattice-constant InGaAs as an absorber and wide-gap small-lattice-constant GaAsP as a strain compensator. This MQW is one candidate for a narrow-gap subcell in lattice-matched Ge/GaAs-based multijunction solar cells [26, 27, 28]. It is also a promising material for realizing hot-carrier solar cells [9]. One notable tradeoff is the large bandgap of GaAsP barriers which obstructs photogenerated carriers from being collected as photocurrent. We have proposed in the previous study that the utilization of the tunneling effect can effectively enhance carrier transport and improve cell performance in thin-barrier MQW cells [20]. Although clear evidence of tunneling enhancement has been found, only indirect observation has been made and further study of the microscopic mechanisms is needed.

Here, we have employed the TOF technique to measure electron transport times in InGaAs/GaAsP MQW solar cells with different structural parameters. We have investigated the linearity of carrier transport by varying the number of quantum wells. Furthermore, tunneling transport has been evaluated in MQWs with different barrier thicknesses with and without step interlayers to study the role of the tunneling effect in boosting carrier collection from MQW structures.

## II Experimental Details

### _Sample Preparation_

Samples were grown by metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy. The source materials and growth condition have been explained in [20]. The samples employed in this study consisted of p-i-n GaAs whose structure is shown in Fig. 1(a). The thicknesses of p-doped emitter, i-region, and n-doped base were kept the same in all samples at 200, 600, and 200 nm, respectively. The slightly p-type background carrier concentration in the i-region was compensated with dilute H\({}_{2}\)S by the method in [29] so that the absolute net carrier concentration became below 2 \(\times\) 10\({}^{14}\) cm\({}^{-3}\). The 25-nm-thick p-doped InGaP window was stacked to passivate the surface.

A portion of i-GaAs was replaced by an In\({}_{0.21}\)Ga\({}_{0.79}\)As/ GaAs\({}_{0.6}\)P\({}_{0.4\pm 0.02}\) MQW structure and an additional 9.5-nm-wide In\({}_{0.25}\)Ga\({}_{0.75}\)As single-quantum-well probe for TOF measurement. The position of the probes was kept the same among samples. The MQW structures are summarized in Table I. The Reference (Ref.) sample contains only probe and has no MQW. Samples QW1, QW4, and QW8 indicate MQWs with one, four, and eight wells, respectively. Samples b2nm, b5nm, b8nm are four-stack MQWs with 2, 5, and 8 nm-thick GaAs\({}_{0.58}\)P\({}_{0.42}\) barriers. Sample b2nm/i is similar to b2nm, but contains 3-nm-thick GaAs interlayers in between In\({}_{0.21}\)Ga\({}_{0.79}\)As and GaAs\({}_{0.58}\)P\({}_{0.42}\). The In\({}_{0.21}\)Ga\({}_{0.79}\)As thickness was reduced to preserve the emission wavelength which had been shifted by GaAs insertion. All the structural parameters were determined by X-ray diffraction measurement. The emission wavelength of all probes was fixed to 1060 nm, while that of MQWs was 969 nm for the well-number sample set and 960 nm for the barrier-thickness sample set. It was confirmed that two PL peaks can be spectrally resolved.

Additional four samples were prepared for evaluating electrical properties. Three of them had similar MQW structures with b2nm, b8nm, and b2mm/i shown in Table I, but i-regions were 1-\(\mu\)m-thick approaching MQW cells reported in [7, 28], MQWs were stacked for 20 wells, and probes were removed to investigate cell property under the condition close to actual MQW solar cells. The other one sample was a GaAs bulk cell with 1-\(\mu\)m-thick i-region for reference.

### _Carrier Time-of-Flight Measurement_

Fig. 1(b) shows the concept of TOF measurement. A single quantum well is inserted as a probe in the i-region of p-i-n junction just below an MQW structure. This probe well must have different emission wavelength from MQW. First, carriers are selectively excited near the surface of the samples using a short-penetration-length pulse laser. Second, carriers, which are electrons in p-on-n structures employed in this study, then travel across the MQW region predominantly by the drift transport driven by the internal electric field. Electrons are trapped

and obstructed by wells and barriers in the MQW region, causing a delay in carrier transport. Third, electrons which have travelled across MQW reach the probe and some of them radiatively recombine. By observing TRPL radiated from the probe, and comparing the peak time with that from the Ref. sample, the averaged transport time--TOF--of electrons passing across MQW can be evaluated. Comparing the peak time with the Ref. sample can exclude the delay factors other than transport time, such as detector response and carrier dynamics inside the quantum-well probes, for more comprehensive TOF analysis [21].

Since only electrons reach the probe, radiative recombination hardly occurs, resulting in weak probe signal. Applying forward bias steadily supplies both types of carriers in the probe for more effective radiation. Hence, the forward bias of 0.6 V was applied during measurement. All the results were measured at room temperature.

### _Optical Measurement Systems_

Pulse laser sources (\(\lambda=405\) nm, spot size \(=0.09\) mm\({}^{2}\)), which have a penetration depth less than 20 nm in GaAs, were used for surface-selective excitation. Two optical systems were used to measure TRPL. The first system contained a mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser with sub-ps pulse width and a streak camera which can measure 3-D images of TRPL spectra. Temporal and spectral resolutions were 40 ps and 1 nm. An acoustooptic modulator-based pulse picker was used to reduce the repetition rate to 4 MHz.

The other system contained a diode laser with 50-ps pulse width and 10-MHz repetition rate and a time correlation single-photon counting (TCSPC) system which has a higher sensitivity to measure at low excitation power. Spectral resolution was 15 nm. The time step of the measurement was 3 ps, but the transit time spread in the photomultiplier tube (PMT) was approximately 500 ps.

### _Carrier Collection Efficiency_

At low electric field, carriers in MQWs encounter a difficulty in escaping out and eventually recombine. This causes the generated current to drop at forward bias. Carrier collection efficiency (CCE) has been proposed to evaluate the effect of carrier transport on output current and is expressed as

\[\text{CCE}(\lambda,V)=\frac{\text{EQE}(\lambda,V)}{\text{EQE}_{\max,\text{ reverse}}(\lambda)} \tag{1}\]

where EQE(\(\lambda\), \(V\)) is the external quantum efficiency at a given illumination wavelength and bias voltage, \(\text{EQE}_{\max,\text{reverse}}(\lambda)\) is the maximum EQE which can be obtained at sufficient reverse bias [30]. CCE gives a fraction of photogenerated carriers that contribute to photocurrent under various electric field strengths. Since carrier escape is sensitive to electric field [17], MQWs with inferior carrier transport tend to give lower CCE, whereas bulk-material solar cells are known to have almost 100% CCE.

405-nm-wavelength monochromatic illumination having a power density of 2.5 mW/cm\({}^{2}\) was used in CCE measurements. The illumination wavelength was matched with that used in TOF measurement to compare the behavior of carriers photogenerated at the surface measured by the two techniques.

## III Results and Discussion

### _Effect of the Number of Wells_

Fig. 2 shows the streak camera images of TRPL spectra from Ref., QW1, QW4, QW8 samples which have different numbers of wells. The excitation energy per pulse was approximately 50 pJ. The TRPL profiles from the probes (\(\lambda=1060\) nm) inserted under MQWs show longer delays and broader peaks with increasing number of wells. Increasing delay confirms that the observation of probe signal can accurately evaluate the carrier transport across MQWs. The broadening of peaks in the time scale suggests that carrier dynamics inside MQWs is like a scattering process which results in the distribution of arrival times. This is thought to be due to the cascade dynamics of carrier escape and recapture inside quantum wells occurring until carriers can completely escape from the MQW region. The other peak at 969-nm wavelength is the emission from MQWs.

Fig. 3 shows the TRPL profiles from the probe in QW1 sample after being excited with different laser powers. TCSPC was used

Fig. 2: Streak camera images of the (a) Ref., (b) QW1, (c) QW4, and (d) QWS cells after 405-nm-wavelength pulse excitation. The color scale was manually adjusted so that the emission can be clearly seen. The 1060-nm PL was from the probes and the 969-nm PL was from the MQWs. Note that forward bias of 0.6 V was applied during measurement to enhance the radiative recombination in the probes.

to observe signals at low excitation power. The TRPL profile of the probe has a tendency to be broad in the time scale when the excitation power becomes high. Therefore, the excitation energy per pulse was kept low enough to cause no broadening while keeping S/N ratio high enough. These were 6, 8, 16, and 25 pJ per pulse for Ref., QW1, QW4, and QW8 samples, respectively. We have confirmed that the time profiles do not significantly broaden at these excitation powers for all the samples.

The TOF results are shown in Fig. 4. The time shifts of the probe signal peaks from the peak position in Ref. sample, defined as TOF, are 0.4, 1.5, and 3.2 ns in QW1, QW4, and QW8, respectively. The figure shows that TOF increases almost linearly with the number of wells. The linearity of carrier transport provides evidence that carrier transport in MQWs has a similar behavior to the drift transport in bulk materials. This allows us to derive an averaged _transport time per well_, which is 0.4 ns in this structure. These findings, including drift and scattering behaviors, provide a clue for more accurate modeling of carrier dynamics and lead to further understanding of the characteristics of MQW solar cells.

### _Investigation of Tunneling Transport_

The results of TOF measurement in b2nm, b5nm, b8nm samples, whose GaAsP barrier thicknesses were 2, 5, and 8 nm, are shown as the middle three profiles in Fig. 5(a). The excitation energies per pulse were 6, 6, 12, and 25 pJ for Ref., b2nm, b5nm, and b8nm samples, respectively. TOFs in 5- and 8-nm-barrier MQW sample are found to be 1.1 nm and 2.3 ns. On the other hand, extremely short TOF of 0.13 ns can be obtained in the 2-nm-barrier MQW sample, smaller than the 5- and 8-nm-barrier sample by approximately 1/10 and 1/20, respectively. Since the MQWs contained four quantum wells, the averaged carrier transport time per well is estimated to be approximately 30 ps. Note that in this p-on-n structure, TOF measurement observed electron transport [see Fig. 1(b)] so that the obtained TOF values are for the electron transport times. The measured TOF in the thin-barrier sample is extremely small and might include the time taken by electrons to escape from the last InGaAs well to the GaAs host material. Hence, more accurate _tunneling transport time_ across one barrier could be obtained after removing this effect; for instance, by investigating well-number dependence on TOF similarly to what was done in Section III-A but with thinner barriers.

The result is consistent with our past study [20] reporting that MQW solar cells with barriers thinner than 3 nm can suppress the current drop at forward bias. We predicted that the improvement of cell performance in thin-barrier MQWs originates from fast tunneling transport, which helps photogenerated electrons escape from MQWs fast enough before they recombine. The notably short TOF in this study is the direct observation of tunneling transport and confirms our prediction. It would be concluded that the utilization of tunneling transport by decreasing barrier thickness can mitigate the carrier collection problem in MQWs and, therefore, is an effective approach for the performance enhancement in MQW solar cells.

### _Carrier Transport in Multistep Potential_

We inserted 3-nm-thick, strain-neutral GaAs interlayers in between InGaAs wells and GaAsP barriers as shown in Fig. 6(a). Although the insertion of GaAs interlayers in InGaAs/GaAsP

Fig. 4: TRPL profiles from probes inserted under MQWs with different numbers of wells using the TCSPC measurement system. Peak times are indicated with dashed lines. Delay caused by MQW is found to be almost linear with the number of quantum wells. Small peak near 3 ns is an artifact from the PMT used in this measurement.

TOF increases significantly with increasing barrier thickness. (b) Zoomed in TRPL profiles of 2-nm-barrier MQWs with and without interlayers. The peak times of sample with and without interlayers are shown as a fall line and a dashed line, respectively. The sample with interlayers shows shorter TOF across MQWs.

MQWs coherently grown on GaAs substrates does not change the strain-balance condition, it improves the steepness of strain profile at the interfaces, resulting in better crystal quality and larger number of quantum-well stacks that can be grown without lattice relaxation [31].

Fig. 6(b) and (c) shows the streak camera images of 2-nm-barrier MQW sample without and with GaAs interlayers. The spectrum broadening of MQW emission (960 nm) from the sample without interlayers is due to the ground-state wavefunction coupling between the neighboring quantum wells [20]. As can be seen from the probe signal (1060 nm), no degradation of carrier transport occurs after inserting GaAs interlayers. Since the total thickness of GaAs and GaAsP between two adjacent wells in the sample with 3-nm interlayers (b2nm/i) was 8 nm, the same as the 8-nm GaAsP MQW sample (b8nm), the direct tunneling transport between two ground states should have been sufficiently suppressed. The observation of short TOF regardless of the insertion of interlayers suggests that the electron transport across thin barriers should rather be explained by the thermally assisted tunneling effect, where electrons distributed in the upper energy levels tunnel to the neighboring wells.

On comparing the probe signal of 2-nm-barrier MQW samples with and without GaAs interlayers under the same excitation energy of 6 pJ per pulse shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b), TOF becomes even shorter from 0.13 to 0.08 ns after introducing interlayers. Since the uncertainty of fitted peak time was within 0.01 ns, we can say that this difference is significant. This implies that the interlayers not only avoid the degradation of carrier transport, but they additionally help suppress the formation of trap states and nonradiative recombination paths, resulting in superior carrier transport. This agrees well with the previous reports [32] and [33], which have reported the reduction of the nonradiative recombination process after introducing interlayers.

The effect of the microscopic dynamics on the solar cell performance is studied using CCE defined by (1). CCEs of 20-stack MQW solar cells with similar MQW structures to b2nm, b8nm, b2nm/i samples are shown in Fig. 7. As shown in the figure as well as that reported in [20], thinner barriers enhance electron transport via fast tunneling escape, resulting in the improvement of CCE. As demonstrated in the figure, CCE is found to be further improved by inserting GaAs interlayers into well/barrier heterosurfaces. The thin-barrier MQW cell with interlayers achieves excellent CCE of over 99% until 0.6 V, approaching the performance of the bulk reference cell. Note that CCE slightly less than 100% in the bulk reference is possibly due to an imperfect window layer or a lack of back surface field layer in our cell structure. At the maximum-power voltage, CCE is improved from 90.4% to 92.9% as the barrier thickness decreases from 8 to 2 nm, and is further improved to 96.5% after adding interlayers with less than 1% drop from the bulk reference. This can be explained by the remarkably fast thermally assisted tunneling transport confirmed by the TOF measurement. The almost bulk-like properties of TOF (carrier transport time) and CCE (photocurrent preservation) in the MQWs with thin barriers and multistep interfaces imply that we can achieve InGaAs/GaAsP MQW solar cells with almost no carrier obstruction from potential barriers.

## IV Conclusion

In this study, we have investigated the carrier transport dynamics in InGaAs/GaAsP MQW solar cells in the microscopic scale using a TOF measurement technique. On investigating TOF in MQWs with different numbers of wells, we have found that the averaged carrier transport time across MQWs increases almost linearly with the number of wells, indicating that carriers have a constant effective drift velocity. We have also examined TOF in MQWs with different barrier thicknesses, and found that the electron transport time per well in a 2-nm-barrier MQW is particularly short, in the order of ten picoseconds. The transport time 20 times shorter than 8-nm-barrier MQW confirms

No degradation of carrier transport can be observed regardless of the insertion of interlayers.

The highest voltages indicated in the figure are the cell maximum power points, which are 0.80, 0.72, 0.71, 0.77 V for the bulk reference, 2-nm-barrier MQW, 8-nm-barrier MQW, and 2-nm-barrier MQW with interlayers, respectively. MQW with thinner barriers results in better CCE. CCE is further improved after the insertion of strain-neutral GaAs interlayers.

the effectiveness of tunneling transport on photocarrier extraction. Faster electron transport after inserting additional GaAs interlayers leads to the conclusion that the dynamics of electrons is dominated by thermally assisted tunneling transport, and it is sensitive to the quality of the layer interface.

We have demonstrated that the efficiency of photocarrier collection from MQWs which have extremely short TOF approaches the value for bulk solar cells. These understandings of the effect of structures on the carrier escape behavior, together with further investigation on 1) hole transport by examining n-on-p structures and 2) the analytical relation between TOF and \(I\)-\(V\) characteristics, can lead to the optimization of MQW structure toward the realization of quantum-structure-based third-generation solar cells.
