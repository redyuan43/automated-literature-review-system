## I Introduction

Continuous-wave (CW) distributed feedback (DFB) quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) are especially attractive coherent single-mode light sources in the mid-infrared regime [1]. For various applications, such as trace gas sensing, free-space communications and pollution monitoring, high-performance surface emission allowing for a low beam divergence is highly desirable [2, 3, 4]. Since the light generated in QCL is transverse-magnetic (TM) polarized, conventional vertical cavity surface-emitting structure is not feasible in this configuration. Consequently, a popular way to realize surface emission is by the use of a second-order Bragg grating for feedback and outcoupling. The surface-emitting DFB QCLs operating in continuous wave (CW) at room temperature have already been demonstrated, but these lasers require a buried second-order grating and therefore an epitaxial growth after the grating fabrication on InGaAs confining layer of the QCL active region is needed [5, 6]. An alternative to this sophisticated and expensive approach is to make use of the surface waves of a grating etched in the top highly doped waveguide layer [7, 8, 9]. However, the introduction of a metal in the grating groove usually will result in a high metal absorption loss. Especially, the second-order grating designed by _A. Lyakh et al._ was fabricated in a thin cladding layer [10]. As a result, this type of surface-emitting QCL suffers from a much larger waveguide loss comparing to their Fabry-Perot (FP) counterparts. Recently, _C. Sigler et al._ designed a surface-emitting top grating-coupled DFB QCL allowing for single mode lasing at low threshold current and high slope efficiency, which was predicted with the potential for watt-range CW power emission [11]. However, no further progress on the structure is achieved. More recently, _P. Jouy et al._ presented a surface emitting laser array design based on distributed Bragg reflectors together with a second-order top grating DFB extractor for low optical losses and efficient heat dissipation [12]. Yet the realization of CW operation at room temperature for such top grating surface-emitting structure is still an unsolved problem owing to the fabrication imperfections. Up to now, top grating surface emission was obtained in pulsed mode only. Encouraging by the index-coupled top grating design by _M. Carras et al._[13], we optimize the second-order metal/semiconductor surface grating design by incorporating the DFB structure on a thicker waveguide, along with the control of an appropriate grating duty cycle, to achieve a low loss coupling mechanism with a proper coupling strength.

In this letter, single-mode CW emission via the substrate at room temperature was demonstrated for a 4.8 \(\mu\)m top grating laser. For a 13-\(\mu\)m-wide and 4-mm-long laser, CW output power of 94 mW was obtained at 25 \({}^{\circ}\)C with a low threshold current density of 1.21 kA/cm\({}^{2}\). A far-field radiation pattern with a low divergence angle of \(0.58^{\circ}\times 16.2^{\circ}\) is obtained. Reliable single-mode emission with a side-mode suppression ratio (SMSR) about 30 dB was achieved from 10 \({}^{\circ}\)C to 40 \({}^{\circ}\)C.

## II Device Design and Fabrication

The QCL structure described in this letter was grown by solid-source molecular beam epitaxy on an n-InP (Si, \(2\times 10^{17}\) cm\({}^{-3}\)) substrate based on a double-phonon resonant design. The active region of each laser structure consists of 35 superlattice periods, which are alternating strain-compensated In\({}_{0.669}\)Ga\({}_{0.331}\)As/In\({}_{0.362}\)Al\({}_{0.638}\)As quantum well and barrier layers. The layer sequence and thickness are identical to that in Ref. [14]. The entire structure was as follows: 1.34 \(\mu\)m lower InP cladding layer (Si, \(1.5\times 10^{17}\) cm\({}^{-3}\)),0.3 \(\mu\)m-thick In\({}_{0.53}\)Ga\({}_{0.47}\)As layer (Si, 4 \(\times\) 10\({}^{16}\) cm\({}^{-3}\)), 1.764 \(\mu\)m active core, 0.3 \(\mu\)m-thick In\({}_{0.53}\)Ga\({}_{0.47}\)As layer (Si, 4 \(\times\) 10\({}^{16}\) cm\({}^{-3}\)), 2.6 \(\mu\)m upper InP cladding layer (Si, 3 \(\times\) 10\({}^{16}\) cm\({}^{-3}\)), 0.15 \(\mu\)m gradually doped InP contact layer (Si, 1 \(\times\) 10\({}^{17}\) cm\({}^{-3}\) to 3 \(\times\) 10\({}^{17}\) cm\({}^{-3}\)), and finally a highly doped InP contact layer (Si, 5 \(\times\) 10\({}^{18}\) cm\({}^{-3}\)) as the host layer for the grating.

According to the coupled-wave theory for gratings [15], the feedback in the DFB structure relies on periodic modulation of refractive index. For a second order grating, first-order diffraction perpendicular to the plane contributes to surface emission and second-order diffraction parallel to the plane provides feedback. Here we simulated the second-order surface grating structure with different cap layer thickness and grating duty cycle \(\sigma\) (defined by the ratio of grating teeth and period) based on finite-element method with periodical boundary condition to find the optimal grating design. The material properties of active region and waveguide are taken into account in term of complex refractive index\({}_{x}\) Fig. 1 (a) shows the modal loss as a function the cap layer thickness. For the second uniform grating, the coupling coefficient is proportional to the Fourier components \(\varepsilon=\sin(\sigma 2\pi)\), which implies a larger coupling coefficient when \(\sigma=25\%\). The two DFB modes illustrated in the inset of Fig. 1 (a), denoted as mode 1 and mode 2, correspond to the asymmetric mode and symmetric mode respectively. The calculation result reveals the value of modal loss for mode 1 is always smaller than that for mode 2. Consequently, the asymmetric mode is always the lasing mode for lower threshold gain. Besides, the largest loss gap between the two modes appears when the cap layer thickness denotes 0.4 \(\mu\)m, which contributes to the stability of emission of the low loss mode. For a fixed cap layer thickness of 0.4 \(\mu\)m and a grating depth of 190 nm, Fig. 1 (b) shows the coupling coefficient \(\kappa\) as the grating duty cycle changes, and the inset shows the scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the grating structure.

Given the duty cycle \(\sigma=25\%\), we obtained a coupling coefficient \(\kappa=4.4\) cm\({}^{-1}\). For 4-mm-long cavities, a moderate coupling strength \(\kappa\)L of \(\sim\)1.76 is deduced, which is appropriate for an efficient surface emission. Based on the results of the simulation, a 0.4 \(\upmu\)m-thick highly doped layer was grown, and the second-order grating with a period of \(\Lambda=1.5\)\(\mu\)m and duty cycle \(\sigma=25\%\) (purposed at 15% \(\sim\) 35%) was defined using holographic lithography technique and transferred by wet chemical etching to the depth of about 190 nm.

After the fabrication of the second-order grating on the top highly doping layer, the wafer was etched into double channel waveguide laser with an average core width of 13 \(\mu\)m by conventional photolithography and non-selective chemical etching. A 450 nm-thick SiO\({}_{2}\) insulating layer was deposited by Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) around the ridges. After evaporation of the top non-alloyed Ti/Au contacts, an additional 5-\(\mu\)m-thick gold layer was electroplated subsequently around the laser ridges to further improve heat dissipation. After being thinned down to about 120 \(\mu\)m, a Ge/Au/Ni/Au metal contact layer was deposited on the substrate side of the wafer. For surface emission from the substrate, a 150 \(\mu\)m-wide window was left on the substrate contact layer by metal lift-off. Finally, the waveguides were cleaved into 4-mm-long bars. The HR coating, consisting of Al\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)/Ti/Au/Al\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) (200/10/100/120 nm), was deposited on the back facet by e-beam evaporation.

## III Device Characterization

The devices were mounted epilayer side down on SiC heat sinks with indium solder for effective heat dissipation and wire bonded to an external contact pad. Then the heat sink was mounted on a holder containing a thermoelectric cooler (TEC) and a thermistor to regulate and monitor the temperature. The emitted optical power was measured with a calibrated thermopile detector placed right in front of the laser facet without any correction. The measurement of lasing spectra was performed with a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer with a resolution of 0.25 cm\({}^{-1}\) in rapid scan mode. Far-field characterization was performed by placing the laser on a stepped motor control rotational stage with a resolution of 0.05\({}^{\circ}\) in cavity-length direction and 0.5\({}^{\circ}\) in ridge-width direction. A nitrogen-cooled HgCdTe detector was located 30 cm away to collect the lasing light.

Fig. 2 shows the typical CW light-current-voltage (L-I-V) curve of the 13-\(\mu\)m-wide and 4-mm-long laser at different heat sink temperatures from 20 to 40 \({}^{\circ}\)C. For temperature characteristics of the DFB QCL, CW output power was observed to decrease from 101 to 40 mW, while the threshold current density increased from 1.15 kA/cm\({}^{2}\) to 1.35 kA/cm\({}^{2}\) at heat sink temperatures of 20 and 40 \({}^{\circ}\)C. This high surface emission performance is attributed to the thicker and low loss waveguide used in this structure. The CW output power of 94 mW from the substrate facet was obtained at 25 \({}^{\circ}\)C, with a low threshold current density of 1.21 kA/cm\({}^{2}\). In contrast, the edge-emitting output power of the same device was also measured in Fig. 2. The CW output power of 356 mW was obtained at 20 \({}^{\circ}\)C. For the n-InP doped substrate thickness of 120 \(\mu\)m and doping level of \(2\times 10^{17}\) cm\({}^{-3}\), the optical transmission at the substrate-air interface for this lasing wavelength is about 30%. The ratio between surface emission and edge emission is derived to be about 0.95 for this device, which indicates a comparative extraction efficiency of substrate direction. Nevertheless, an existing anti-reflective coating on the substrate facet will result to 25% increase in the output power. Besides, the optical power and outcoupling efficiency for the surface emission can be further increased by optimizing the waveguide design [11, 12], which is worthy of future study.

Fig. 3 shows the CW surface emission spectra of the second-order top grating DFB QCL at different heat sink temperatures from 10 \({}^{\circ}\)C to 40 \({}^{\circ}\)C. A single-mode emission is observed among the entire investigated temperature range with a SMSR about 30 dB at injection currents of 1.1 Ith. As is shown in the upper inset of Fig. 4, the peak emission spectrum was observed to shift from 2068.3 cm\({}^{-1}\) at 10 \({}^{\circ}\)C to 2057.1 cm\({}^{-1}\) at 40 \({}^{\circ}\)C, corresponding to a temperature tuning coefficient \(\Delta v/\Delta\mathrm{T}=-0.374\) cm\({}^{-1}\cdot\mathrm{K}^{-1}\). The lower inset shows the lasing spectra of the same device at different injection currents in CW operation at 20 \({}^{\circ}\)C. As the driving current increases from 0.7 A to 0.9 A with a step of 0.5 A, the peak emission spectrum shifts from 2065.4 cm\({}^{-1}\) to 2063.2 cm\({}^{-1}\). A current tunability of \(-10.75\) cm\({}^{-1}\cdot\mathrm{A}^{-1}\) was obtained. Stable single-longitudinal-mode operation to relatively high driving currents and over a wide range of heat sink temperatures is expected, because second-order DFB lasers are inherently complex-coupled devices for which the mode of least radiation loss is the one favored to lase. The present of loss-coupling component, combining with the dominating index-coupling scheme, would prevent the device radiation from oscillation at both edges of the stop-band [16].

Fig. 4 shows the far-field patterns of the emission light from the substrate of the DFB QCL in pulsed operation at room temperature. As shown in Fig. 4 (a), a typical double-lobe far field pattern with a separation of 0.58\({}^{\circ}\) full width at half maximum (FWHM) is obtained in the direction along the waveguide. Theoretical calculation above reveals the lowest threshold mode in our devices is anti-symmetric, where the near field has a node at the center of the device, resulting in this double-lobed far field pattern [17]. However, the far-field

The upper inset shows the linearly fit tuning characteristics of the lasing frequency with temperature.

pattern can be made single-lobed by simply incorporating a \(\pi\) phase shift in the grating center [18]. The far field distribution also depends on the position of the mirrors in relation to the grating, which accounts for the different intensity of the two lobes. Whereas in the ridge-width direction illustrated in Fig. 4 (b), emission is relatively divergent with FWHM of \(16.2^{\circ}\), which is equivalent to the typical far-field angle observed in the corresponding direction of the facet.

## IV Conclusion

In conclusion, we report top grating, surface-emitting DFB QCLs at 4.8 \(\mu\)m operating in continuous wave at room temperature. For a 13-\(\mu\)m-wide and 4-mm-long laser, the CW output power emitted from the substrate reached 94 mW at heat sink temperature of 25 \({}^{\circ}\)C with a low threshold current density of 1.21 kA/cm\({}^{2}\). Single-mode emission with a side-mode suppression ratio (SMSR) about 30 dB is continuously tunable by the heat sink temperature or injection current. A far-field radiation pattern with a low divergence angle of \(0.58^{\circ}\times 16.2^{\circ}\) is obtained.
