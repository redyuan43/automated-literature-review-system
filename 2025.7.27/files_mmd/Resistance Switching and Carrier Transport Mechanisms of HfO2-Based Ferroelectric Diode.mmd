## I Introduction

The interest of developing ferroelectric memory has been revived by the discovery of HfO\({}_{2}\)-based ferroelectric [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. In terms of CMOS compatibility, thickness scaling, and conformal deposition for 3-D structure, HfO\({}_{2}\)-based ferroelectric exhibits a variety of benefits over traditional perovskite-based ferroelectric. Among various kinds of ferroelectric memory, ferroelectric tunnel junction (FTJ) and ferroelectric diode (FD) are attracting much attention for high-density and low-power memory applications owing to their two-terminal structure and nondestructive readout [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. Especially, FD with relatively thick ferroelectric and self-rectifying characteristic can suppress sneak path and enable crossbar array integration without additional selectors.

Recently, FD with fast switching speed and low-power consumption has been experimentally demonstrated [12, 13, 14, 15]. To improve the current ratio between low-resistance state (LRS) and high-resistance state (HRS), the structure of FD evolves from a conventional metal/ferroelectric/metal (MFM) type to a metal/ferroelectric/insulator/semiconductor (MFIS) type by engineering the asymmetricity of energy band [13, 14]. Particularly, amorphous oxide semiconductor like InGaZnO\({}_{\text{x}}\) (IGZO) featuring low-thermal-budget process and improved interface quality with ferroelectric HfO\({}_{2}\) has become a promising candidate as the semiconductor layer of MFIS-type FD for 3-D integration [13, 16, 17]. However, the dominant carrier transport processes in different resistance states as well as their switching become complicated because of the complex band structure and the traps existing at the interface of MFIS-type FD. Both interface-limited and bulk-limited carrier transport processes may contribute to the conduction of MFIS-type FD [18]. Therefore, studying on switching mechanisms as well as carrier transport processes of MFIS-type FD with ferroelectric HfO\({}_{2}\) and IGZO is of great significance for understanding the device physics as well as further performance improvement.

In this work, we have fabricated MFIS-type FD with HfZrO\({}_{\text{x}}\) (HZO) and IGZO as ferroelectric and semiconductor layers, respectively. By Al\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) capping on HZO, decent ferroelectricity with a low thermal budget of 400 \(\lx@math@degree\)C is realized, which is important for monolithic 3-D integration. The devices show robust memory window (MW) and self-rectifying characteristic, which is promising for the next-generation high-density and low-power memory. The resistance switching mechanisms and the carrier transport processes in different resistance states are also systematically studied for understanding the fundamental device physics as well as further device optimization of MFIS-type FD.

## II Device Fabrication

Fig. 1(a) schematically illustrates a crossbar array with FD at crosspoints and the structure of FD studied in this work. The fabrication of FD starts from silicon (Si) substrate.

After conventional RCA clean, 100-nm SiO\({}_{2}\) serving as an isolation layer is deposited by sputter. Then, 30-nm TiN is deposited by sputter for bottom electrode (BE). Subsequently, samples are split into two different processes. For process A, 10-nm HZO and 1-nm Al\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) are sequentially deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD). Next, postdeposition anneal (PDA) is performed at 400 \({}^{\circ}\)C in N\({}_{2}\) atmosphere for 30 s to crystalize HZO. For process B, PDA is performed just after 10-nm HZO deposition, and then, 1-nm Al\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) is deposited. Subsequently, 10-nm amorphous IGZO is deposited by sputter and patterned by diluted HCl. Finally, 10-nm Ti and 100-nm Al are deposited by e-beam evaporation and lift-off for top electrode (TE). Fig. 1(b) summarizes the key process flow of device fabrication. The whole process is under thermal budget of 400 \({}^{\circ}\)C, which is back-end-of-line (BEOL) compatible and enables monolithic 3-D integration of memory arrays. Fig. 1(c) and (d) shows the cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image and the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping of a fabricated TiN/HZO/Al\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)/IGZO/Ti structure.

## 3 Results and Discussion

### _Memory Characteristic of FD_

Fig. 2(a) and (b) plots the charge versus BE voltage (\(Q\)-\(V_{\text{BE}}\)) characteristic and corresponding transient current in response to a triangular waveform applied at the BE, respectively. The measurement frequency is 1 kHz and the voltage amplitude is 4 V. Devices fabricated by process A show decent ferroelectricity. However, devices fabricated by process B show paraelectric property. The higher remnant polarization (\(P_{r}\)) of devices fabricated by process A can be attributed to higher ferroelectric phase fraction of HZO induced by Al\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) capping after PDA [19, 20]. Fig. 2(c) and (d) illustrates the endurance and retention characteristics of devices fabricated by process A. The cycling frequency and voltage amplitude for endurance measurement are 20 kHz and 4 V, respectively.

Fig. 3(a) plots the current density versus \(V_{\text{BE}}\) by dc dual sweep measurement for devices with various areas by process A. Current peaks induced by ferroelectric polarization switching can be directly observed in both forward and reverse sweeps. Note that current density versus \(V_{\text{BE}}\)

(\(J\)\(-\)\(V_{\text{BE}}\)) characteristics are independent on device areas, which indicates that the switching between HRS and LRS is governed by an electric field-modulated mechanism rather than filament growth like resistive random access memory (RRAM) [18, 21, 22]. Fig. 3(b) shows the device-to-device (D2D) variation of \(J\) at \(V_{\text{BE}}=1.5\) V in both HRS and LRS for 20 devices. The inset plots the corresponding \(J\)\(-\)\(V_{\text{BE}}\) curves of 20 devices measured by dc dual sweep. Stable switching between HRS and LRS is confirmed by measurement results. However, devices fabricated by process B do not show such kind of memory characteristic, as shown in Fig. 3(c), which means ferroelectric polarization switching should be responsible for the resistance switching of devices by process A. Fig. 3(d) illustrates pulse schemes for retention and conductance tuning measurement. A pulse with an amplitude of 6 V and a width of 1 ms is for program/potentiation, while a pulse with an amplitude of \(-\)4 V and a width of 100 \(\mu\)s is for erase/depression. Fig. 3(e) plots the retention characteristic for LRS and HRS after write. The current readout is performed by a voltage pulse with 1-V amplitude to avoid potential read disturb due to partial polarization reversal at higher read voltage, as polarization switching occurs at \(V_{\text{BE}}=\sim\)2 V [Figs. 2(a) and 3(a)]. Fig. 3(f) plots the measured potentiation/depression with identical pulses. Multiple conductance states are achieved, which shows potential for synaptic devices.

### Resistance Switching Mechanisms

The resistance switching mechanism of devices by process A is further investigated by modulating the maximum positive voltage (\(V_{\text{P}}\)) applied to BE in dc dual sweeps. As \(V_{\text{P}}\) increases from 4.5 to 5 V, the hysteresis of \(J\)\(-\)\(V_{\text{BE}}\) evolves from clockwise to counterclockwise [Fig. 4(a) and (b)]. The hysteresis becomes larger when \(V_{\text{P}}=5.5\) V [Fig. 4(c)]. However, polarization is fully switched for all the three cases, as the current peaks in transient measurements are exactly the same for three different \(V_{P}\) values [Fig. 4(d)]. Therefore, the resistance switching is not solely induced by ferroelectric polarization switching.

To clarify another possible origin for resistance switching observed in devices by process A, the measurement sequence, as shown in Fig. 5(a), is employed. Initially, a conventional dc dual sweep is performed, and the forward and reverse sweeps are denoted as 1 and 2, respectively. Subsequently, a dc dual sweep with various hold time (\(t_{\text{hold}}\)) at \(V_{P}\) is carried out, and the corresponding forward and reverse sweeps are denoted as 3 and 4, respectively. Fig. 5(b) plots the measured \(J\)\(-\)\(V_{\text{BE}}\) in 1, 2, 3, and 4 for \(V_{\text{P}}=4.5\) V and \(t_{\text{hold}}=500\) ms as an example. Although polarization is fully switched, no MW exists (clockwise hysteresis) for \(\copyright\) and 2, which is the same as the result shown in Fig. 4(a). However, if sufficient \(t_{\text{hold}}\) is applied, MW occurs for 3 and 4. Fig. 5(c) plots \(J\)\(\oplus\)\(V_{\text{BE}}=1.5\) V from the measurement results in 3 as a function of \(t_{\text{hold}}\). MW becomes larger as both \(t_{\text{hold}}\) and \(V_{P}\) increase. The above measurement results indicate that the resistance switching of devices by process A can be attributed to polarization switching combined with sufficient electron trapping, which can be induced by either high \(V_{P}\) [Fig. 4(c)] or large \(t_{\text{hold}}\) [Fig. 5(b)].

### Carrier Transport Mechanisms in HRS and LRS

Next, the dominant carrier transport processes are determined by current fitting to possible conduction models. To avoid the impact of polarization switching current on the fitting results, current in reverse sweeps [2 for HRS and 4 for LRS in Fig. 5(b)] is chosen for the conduction current fitting. The fitting results show that the conduction current in HRS follows thermionic emission (TE) [18, 23], as shown in Fig. 6(a), and the extracted barrier height (\(\varphi_{\text{B}}\)) according to the intercept of \(y\) axis is \(\sim\)1.18 eV. This value is close to the theoretical one calculated by the difference between electron affinity of Al\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) (\(\sim\)2.58 eV) [24] and IGZO (\(\sim\)4.14 eV) [25].

Polarization is fully switched for all the three cases as indicated by almost the same switching current.

(b) Measured \(J\)–\(V_{\text{BE}}\) in 1, 2, 3, and 4 for \(V_{P}=4.5\) V and \(t_{\text{hold}}=500\) ms as an example. (c) \(J\)\(\oplus\)\(V_{\text{BE}}=1.5\) V from the measurement results in 3 as a function of \(t_{\text{hold}}\).

On the other hand, the conduction current in LRS follows Poole-Frenkel (PF) emission [26, 27, 28], as illustrated by Fig. 6(b), and the extracted trap energy level (\(\varphi_{\rm r}\)) from the conduction band edge of HZO is \(\sim\)0.58 eV, which is consistent with the value of \(\sim\)0.6 eV extracted from MFM capacitors [27, 28]. The bulk-limited PF emission and lower barrier height assisted by traps in HZO result in LRS.

According to the abovementioned measurement results and the carrier transport processes in HRS and LRS, we can summarize the resistance switching mechanism of devices by process A as follows. Fig. 7 schematically illustrates the energy band diagrams of FD with TiN/HZO/Al\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)/IGZO structure for three different cases.

1. Polarization is switched toward TiN by applying negative \(V_{\rm BE}\) (negative polarization, \(-\)P) and large barrier height for electron exists during read [Fig. 7(a)]. In this way, negligible current flowthrough the whole stack and FD is in HRS.
2. Polarization is switched toward IGZO (positive polarization, \(+\)P) by applying sufficiently large positive \(V_{\rm BE}\) and barrier height is reduced compared to case (1) [Fig. 7(b)]. However, the device is still in HRS due to the interface-limited TE with relatively thick 10-nm HZO.
3. If sufficient electron trapping happens with \(+\)P state, hopping rate increases due to higher density of pairs of occupied and empty traps in HZO [14, 18]. As a result, the conduction process transforms to bulk-limited PF emission and the device is in LRS. Table I summarizes the device structure, performance, conduction, and switching mechanisms of FD in this work compared with other reported FD/FTI in the literature. This work shows that polarization switching combined with sufficient charge trapping is responsible for the switching to LRS of FD with relatively thick ferroelectric layer. In such cases, the carrier transport mechanism in LRS is usually governed by trap-assisted process like PF emission. Therefore, the switching and carrier transport mechanisms illustrated in this work should be carefully considered for the design as well as performance optimization of FD/FTJ.

## IV Conclusion

We have fabricated MFIS-type FD with robust MW and self-rectifying characteristic. The resistance switching mechanisms are systematically investigated by electrical measurement and current fitting to possible carrier transport models. The dominant carrier transport processes for HRS and LRS are TE and PF emission, respectively. The switching from HRS to LRS is attributed to ferroelectric polarization switching combined with sufficient electron trapping. The mechanisms demonstrated in this work provide new insight into memory characteristics of MFIS-type FD with ferroelectric HfO\({}_{2}\) and IGZO.
