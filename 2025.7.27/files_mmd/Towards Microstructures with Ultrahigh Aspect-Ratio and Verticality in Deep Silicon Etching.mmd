## I Introduction

Though two-dimensional materials and III-V group materials are thought to be promising in the fabrication of next-generation electronic devices, silicon-based devices are still the mainstream of the modern semiconductor industry, and tremendous efforts have been made to perpetuate the vitality of silicon. Introducing deep trench structure into silicon devices is one of the approaches to ameliorate the device performance. For instance, carrier mobility reduction caused by channel electron scattering and undesirable short channel effect could be both inhibited when trench gate is utilized to substitute traditional planar gate [1, 2]. Super junction is another example for device performance improvement by deep microstructures [3, 4], which could effectively reduce the on-resistance/higher doping concentration and increase the switching rate/shorten depletion region. For the reason that the driving current in super junction devices with planar structure is low, vertical super junction is generally adopted, where the fabrication technology is developed from multiple epitaxial process to deep trench process. As for discrete devices that originally require trench etching, they are also developing toward high aspect ratio and high vertically. Silicon capacitors are typical devices that requires deep trench structures, which could increase the use efficient of device space and increase the capacitance [5, 6, 7]. The higher verticality makes it more consistent between the practical device and the theoretical model, which better meets the design demands. Therefore, the development of semiconductor discrete devices has witnessed increasing demands on deep trench etching.

Owing to the high aspect ratio and high verticality in the deep silicon trench, conventional wet etching with isotropic reaction is impossible to realize, whereas anisotropic dry etching should be used. Dry etching is a low temperature plasma based technique that uses ionized gas to etch the wafer by physical bombardment and chemical reaction [8-10]. For deep silicon etching, it becomes more difficult as the etching depth increases, where a V-shaped topography is eventually formed. This is mainly due to two reasons: First, the reactive plasma or etchant is hard to enter the deep microstructure, inhibiting the etching at the bottom of the microstructure; second, the product of the etching formed at the bottom is also difficult to carry away from the reaction system, suppressing etching according to chemical equilibrium. Optimizing the hardware of the etching apparatus might partially address the issue with high costs. Thus, to obtain deep silicon microstructures with high aspect ratio and high verticality in practical way has been the direction of both the scientific and industrial community.

In this study, through optimization of the process recipe, a deep silicon trench structure with aspect ratio of \(>\)65, depth of \(>\)100 \(\upmu\)m and high perpendicularity of 90\({}^{\circ}\)\(\triangleq\)0.1\({}^{\circ}\) is achieved. The balance between deposition and etching is controlled by introducing ramping to both the bias power and the etching time. The sidewall of the trench is smooth with scallop size of less than 20 nm, which would not damage the electrical performance of the device. The silicon trench with high aspect ratio and high verticality has significance to advancing the field of silicon device fabrication.

## II Experimental Section

Commercially available 8 inch silicon wafer with (100) face upward was used in this study. SiO\({}_{2}\) hard mask (HM) with thickness of \(\sim\)0.6 \(\upmu\)m was grown on the silicon wafer by PECVD using a NMC EPEE 550. The HM was opened by using Ar and CF\({}_{4}\) plasma in a GDE chamber of a NMC MASE 200 etcher after defined by photo-lithographically. As shown in Fig.1a, the remaining photoresist (PR) is \(\sim\)2.4 \(\upmu\)m thick. The deep dry silicon etching was then performed in a HSE chamber of a NMC MASE 200 etcher. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were taken by using FEI Inspect and Hitachi SU8000.

## III Results And Discussion

Considering the plasma has higher mean free path at lower chamber pressure, it is feasible to obtain deeper microstructures by simply lowering the chamber pressure. However, extremely low chamber pressure would cause troubles in evacuation capability and ignition of radiofrequency (RF). Many hardware upgrades are thus needed to address these issues, such as increasing the pumping rate of the vacuum pump, or improving the RF system.

When compared with hardware upgrade, optimization of the Bosch process recipe is a more convenient method. As shown in Fig. 1b, the etchant needs to enter the trench with depth of \(>\)100 \(\upmu\)m. Bias electrode of RF is the key part to make the plasma generated by the source electrode move downward. Thereby, increasing the bias power could guarantee more plasma to enter the bottom of the deep trench. On the other hand, extending the single-step etching time could promote the products at the bottom of the deep trench to move away from the chemical reaction system. Taking these two aspects into consideration, we design a combined ramping technique as following:

\[P=P_{\text{initial}}+(P_{\text{final}}-P_{\text{initial}})^{\bullet}n/n_{\text{ total}} \tag{1}\]

\[t=t_{\text{initial}}+(t_{\text{final}}-t_{\text{initial}})^{\bullet}n/n_{\text{ total}} \tag{2}\]

where \(P\), \(t\), \(n\), \(n_{\text{total}}\), \(P_{\text{initial}}\), \(P_{\text{final}}\), \(t_{\text{initial}}\) and \(t_{\text{final}}\) are defined to be bias power at present, etching time at present, cycle number at present, Bosch total cycle number, initial bias power, final bias power, initial etching time and final etching time, respectively. The method could be seen by flow chart mode in Fig. 2. Definitely, the final bias power should be larger than the initial bias power, and so is the situation in the etching time.

By using this optimized process technique shown above, a deep trench of silicon with depth of more than 100 \(\upmu\)m could be obtained with critical dimension (CD) width of 1.5 \(\upmu\)m, as illustrated in Fig. 3.

The optimized Bosch process recipe is shown in TABLE I.

The statistics on the etching profile is shown in TABLE II.

It is noted that porous silicon structure could be fabricated by illuminated electrochemical etching with aspect-ratio larger than 100 [11, 12]. However, the sidewall of the microstructure obtained by electrochemical method is rather rough, which hamper the practical application to electronic devices [13, 14]. In addition, Tang _et al_[15] reported ultra-deep reactive ion etching of high aspect-ratio in thick silicon through ramped-parameter process with relatively large trench width variation from top to bottom, whereas the CD width variation in this work is within 0.2 \(\upmu\)m (i.e. better sidewall angle).

Otherwise, control experiments showed that damage and grass appeared in the bottom of the trench if the ramping of bias power and etching time is eliminated (Fig. 5). To avoid the abnormal profile, the depth would be decreased to ~80 \(\upmu\)m (with aspect ratio of ~50). These control results prove the ramping technique is necessary to obtain ultrahigh aspect-ratio and verticality in deep silicon etching.

The deeper of the silicon trench, the harder for the reactive plasma or etchant to enter the deep microstructure. So is the situation for the product of the etching formed at the bottom to carry away from the reaction system. That's why a gradient ramping of the bias power and etching time is required rather than a maximum of them.

## IV Conclusion

In summary, through optimization of the process recipe, we demonstrate a deep silicon trench structure with aspect ratio of >65, depth of >100 \(\upmu\)m and high perpendicularity of 90\({}^{\circ}\)\(\pm\)0.1\({}^{\circ}\). The ramping of both the bias power and the etching time is introduced to control the balance between deposition and etching. The smooth silicon trench with high aspect ratio and high verticality would have potential applications in power chip, micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), and advanced packaging.
