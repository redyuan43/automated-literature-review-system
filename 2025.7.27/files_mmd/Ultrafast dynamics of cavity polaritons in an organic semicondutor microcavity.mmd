## Introduction:

A semiconductor microcavity is fabricated by sandwiching a thin semiconductor layer between two mirrors (Figure 1a). By using diffracting Bragg reflectors (DBRs) instead of metallic mirrors and multiple quantum wells, for inorganic semiconductors, it is possible to achieve strong coupling when the cavity mode is in resonance with the exciton absorption to form two cavity-polariton states that are separated by vacuum field Rabi-splitting energy [1]. Many advances have been made in the study of strongly coupled inorganic semiconductor microcavities [2] including observation of polariton lasing and Bose-Einstein condensates. However, due to weak oscillator strength of Wannier-Mott exciton, Rabi splitting energy is of the order of only few 10s of meV and strong coupling is observed commonly only at cryogenic temperatures.

Frenkel excitons have a much higher oscillator strength which is increased furthermore in J-aggregates due to concentration of emission from the lowest excited state. Consequently they have a narrower absorption and emission line widths and a very small stokes shift making them suitable materials for strong coupling (Figure 1b) with Rabi splitting energy an order of magnitude higher and at room temperatures [3]. In order to protect the organic thin film layer physical vapor deposition instead of molecular beam epitaxy has to be used to fabricate the DBRs. This results in a Q-factor of 300 for the cavity. Disorder in organic systems causes inhomogeneous broadening of the exciton absorption; and also modifies the dynamics of the polaritons due to the formation of an uncoupled exciton reservoir [4]. Using pump-probe spectroscopy polariton relaxation dynamics was studied [5] while the Rabi oscillations were observed using time-resolved up-conversion technique.

In pump-probe spectroscopy, a pulse is incident on the sample and excites the ground-state population to a higher electronic or vibrational level, following which a probe pulse arrives after a pre-determined delay on the same spot. The differential transmission of this probe pulse in the presence and absence of the pump pulse gives the transmission induced by the pump pulse. Since the pump pulse populates the excited state, changing the delay between the two pulses gives the excited state dynamics of the sample. While a positive differential transmission corresponds to ground state photo-bleaching or stimulated emission, a negative differential transmission corresponds to excited state absorption induced by the pump pulse.

Time resolved up-conversion technique has been used to study the emission that have a decay time of less than 10 ps as it cannot be resolved by a streak camera [5]. The resolution in this technique depends on the pulse duration of the gate-pulse as the up-conversion takes place only during the time it is incident on the nonlinear crystal. With the arrival of femtosecond lasers, it was possible to get a resolution of 80-150 fs. The estimated photon lifetime for our cavity is 90 fs and the Rabi oscillations have a time period of 35 fs for a Rabi splitting of 120meV. Hence we used 15 fs duration near-IR pulses to resolve this coherent energy exchange between the polariton states. Due to spectrally broad near-IR pulse, an outcome of short duration pulse generation, the frequency resolution of the up-converted spectrum is reduced.

### Experimental:

The pump and probe pulses for pump-probe spectroscopy were generated from two non-collinear optical parametric amplifiers (NOPAs) that are fed from the output of a regerative-amplified mode-locked Ti:Sapphire laser at 780nm and 150fs duration pulses at 1kHz repetition rate. The second harmonic of the laser at 390 nm generated on a 1mm thick BBO crystal was used as the pump and supercontinuum generation on a 1 mm thick sapphire plate was used as the seed for the NOPA to generate broadband pulses centered at 590nm on a 1 mm thick BBO crystal, and compressed using chirped mirror pair to 15 fs time duration [7]. The pump intensity was modulated by a synchronized optical chopper while the delay between the pump and the probe pulses was adjusted by a computer controlled delay stage, and superimposed on the angle-tuned microcavity. The differential probe transmission was collected in an optical multi-channel analyzer (figure 2a).

For the time-resolved up-conversion experiment, while one of the NOPAs was a broadband visible output, the other NOPA was used to generate near-IR pulses centered at 920nm by using a 2 mm thick sapphire plate for the super-continuum generation. The pulse was then compressed using prism pairs to 15 fs duration. The compressed visible pulse, or its transmission through the cavity, and the near-IR pulse,

The pump pulse is modulated by a synchronized optical chopper; while the delay of the probe is varied. Both the pulses are incident on the angle-tuned microcavity.

While the visible pulse passes through the microcavity, the near-IR pulse goes through a variable delay stage to generate sum-frequency on the BBO.

after passing through the delay stage, were overlapped spatially and temporally on a BBO crystal of 20\(\mu\)m thickness with type-1 phase matching to generate sum-frequency in the UV and was collected in a spectrometer(figure 2b). The transmission through the microcavity was time-resolved by changing the delay between the two pulses.

## Results and discussion:

For the cavity at 45\({}^{\circ}\) angle, the polariton peaks were of equal intensity in the transmission spectrum. Theoretical calculations predicted an ultrafast non-radiative decay of the upper polariton branch into the exciton reservoir in a time of about 50 fs and another non-radiative scattering from the exciton reservoir to the lower polariton branch in around 9-350 ps [4]. The amplitude of the pump-induced differential absorption of the exciton reservoir, upper and lower polariton branches was modeled for polariton population based on this theoretical calculation to give decay times of 150 fs and 3.2 ps respectively. A high frequency modulation of the polariton and exciton reservoir population was taken as due to the excitation of intermolecular phonons generated due to these two non-radiative processes. However the Rabi oscillation between the two polariton states could not be easily distinguished. This could be due the overlap of positive and negative signals in the differential transmission through the cavity corresponding to the ground-state bleaching and the excited state absorption. By passing just a single pulse through the cavity in the time-resolved up-conversion technique multiple transitions are avoided and clear oscillations are visible.

The up-conversion of the just the two pulses gave a single pulse spectrum which is the result of cross-correlation of two short pulses. However the transmission through the cavity time-resolved at 0\({}^{\circ}\), 20\({}^{\circ}\) and 30\({}^{\circ}\) angles of incidence show oscillation of 35 fs time period which correspond to Rabi oscillation of the lower polariton branch population. This is supported by the fact that 35 fs corresponds to a Rabi splitting of 120meV at resonance which is observed in the transmission/ reflection spectra through the cavity. Two simultaneous oscillations in the UV, out-of-phase with each other, corresponding to the expected Rabi-splitting at the exciton resonance for the cavity at 40\({}^{\circ}\) were observed. All these oscillations are additionally enveloped by a longer single-exponential decay of time of around 70 fs which is the photon lifetime of the cavity mode.

## Conclusion:

Polariton relaxation dynamics were observed using pump-probe spectroscopy and were found to be in agreement with previously calculated values. Coherent exchange of energy between cavity polariton states in ultrafast time scale was observed in a J-aggregate semiconductor microcavity directly, without any need for data processing, using time-resolved up-conversion technique and once again in agreement with expected values.
