structure, so the \(R_{\text{on}}\) of the JMOS is slightly higher than that of C-MOS, but the \(V_{\text{SD}}\) of JMOS (at \(I_{\text{F}}\)= 10A) is reduced by 60% from 3.8V to 2.28V, compared with that of the C-MOS.

## III Experimental Result and Discussion

The HTRB, HTGB and H3TRB reliability test for the packaged SiC JMOS and C-MOS devices are carried out, and there are 45 samples in each test with no devices failed during the entire test. The electrical parameters (average value) of the samples before and after the reliability test are investigated and compared to judge the reliability of the devices.

### Ahtrb

The HTRB test is conducted to verify the leakage current of the chip over extended periods to ensure long-term stability [8]. During this test, the gate-source is shorted, and the drain is subjected to 80% of the rated breakdown voltage (BV) of the device, specifically 960V for a 1200V-class device. The test duration is 1000 hours at 175\({}^{\circ}\)C. Fig. 3(a) and 3(b) illustrate the comparison results and change rates of electrical parameters of the SiC JMOS and C-MOS before and after the HTRB test, respectively. The SiC JMOS and C-MOS both demonstrate a slightly reduction in \(V_{\text{A}}\) and \(R_{\text{on}}\) after testing, with reductions of approximately -4.8% and -1.1% for JMOS, and -1.3% and -3.6% for C-MOS, respectively. And the high blocking voltage leakage current (\(I_{\text{DSS-IV}}\)) and \(BV^{\prime}\) are almost unchanged. The gate leakage current (\(I_{\text{GSS}}\)- and \(I_{\text{GSS}}\)) of both JMOS and C-MOS changes slightly with a change rate of less than 12.5%. These results demonstrate that JMOS exhibits excellent reliability in the HTRB test, showing no significant difference compared to C-MOS.

The wet and thermal environments can induce physical and chemical effects on devices, leading to moisture absorption, expansion, insulation resistance decline, rust on tubes and shells, electric leakage, and potential short circuits. Moisture and electrical stress can also cause electrochemical migration of metal materials. The H3TRB test primarily assesses the device's ability to withstand electrical, thermal, and humidity stresses. During the test, samples are exposed to conditions with a relative humidity (RH) of 85% and a temperature of 105\({}^{\circ}\)C. The gate-source is shorted, and the drain is subjected to 80% of the rated BV for 1000 hours [9]. Fig. 4(a) and (b) illustrate the comparison results and change rates of electrical parameters of the JMOS and C-MOS before and after the HTRB test, respectively. And the results indicate thermal changes in \(V_{\text{B}}\), \(R_{\text{on}}\) and \(BV\), about -6.9%, -3.8%, 0.08% for JMOS, and -3.9%, -7.0% and 0.23% for C-MOS respectively, after the H3TRB test. Although there are significant changes in \(I_{\text{DSS-IV}}\), they remain within a reasonable order of magnitude and do not significantly impact reliability.

### ChtGb

The HTGB test evaluates the reliability of a device's gate oxide layer by subjecting it to high temperature stress with two variations: high temperature gate forward bias and high temperature gate reverse bias [10]. During this test, samples are exposed to 175\({}^{\circ}\)C, with one group subjected to a +20V gate to source voltage (_V\({}_{\text{GS}}\)_ = +20V) and another to -5V gate to source voltage (_V\({}_{\text{GS}}\)_ = -5V). The duration of each test is 1000 hours. The results of the reverse bias and forward bias tests are illustrated in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 respectively. Under forward bias, electrons from the inversion layer on the channel surface become trapped by defects at the SiC/SiO\({}_{2}\) gate oxide interface, causing a forward shift in _V\({}_{\text{th}}\)_. Conversely, under reverse bias, holes from the channel surface are injected into the SiC/SiO\({}_{2}\) gate oxide layer, resulting in a reverse shift in the _V\({}_{\text{th}}\)_, as depicted in the figures. Under forward bias, the change rates of _V\({}_{\text{th}}\)_ for JMOS and C-MOS are 32.8% and 30.9%, respectively. Under reverse bias, the change rates of _V\({}_{\text{th}}\)_ for JMOS and C-MOS are -17.2% and -9.4%, respectively. Furthermore, the HTGB forward bias test notably affects _I\({}_{\text{BS}}\)_. iv. However, these changes remain within a reasonable range, indicating no significant impact on reliability.

## IV Conclusion

In this study, a new JBS diode-integrated SiC MOSFET (JMOS) and a conventional SiC MOSFET were both designed and fabricated on the same process platform. It was observed that the JMOS exhibited improved performance in the reverse on-state compared with the conventional MOSFET. After packaging, both devices underwent a 1000-hour reliability test. By comparing the electrical parameters before and after reliability testing, we conclude that there is no significant difference in reliability between the JMOS and conventional MOSFET, both devices demonstrate high reliability.
