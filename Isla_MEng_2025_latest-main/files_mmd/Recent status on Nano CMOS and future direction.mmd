## I Importance of Continuous Progress in CMOS Integrated Circuits

Nowadays, CMOS Large Scale Integrated circuits (LSIs), are really indispensable components for our human society. Needless to say, but almost all the human activities, living, production, financing, telecommunication, transportation, medical care, education, entertainment, etc. cannot work without the help of the CMOS LSI operation. For example, all the bank activities immediately stop without CMOS computation. Cellular phones do not exist without CMOS technology. Also, it should not be forgotten that CMOS semiconductor industry is one of big driving forces of world economy, which is not limited to semiconductor fields but also includes many different kinds industries of materials, equipments, and software's required for the integrated circuits.

From now on, the continuous progress of CMOS technologies in terms of high-performance operation and low power consumption is still very important because of the following three reasons. At first, under the rapid progress of aging population and falling birth rate, we need to accelerate the replacement of some of the human jobs by intelligent machines - such as human type robot for elderly-care, for example. For the penetration of such intelligent robots to the daily family use, much higher intelligence and much lower power consumption than those of today are required, and the development of CMOS integrated circuits with much more high performance and low power consumption are indispensable.

Secondly, our society is now facing the global warming. The reduction of the CO\({}_{2}\) gas release is a critically urgent issue for the earth. Continuous progress of CMOS technologies contributes to the 'cooling of the earth' in two ways. One is direct contribution to the power reduction for IT (Information Technology) devices. Explosive increase of energy consumption at office and home are demanded to be suppressed by so called 'Green IT' procedure. This can be done by the development of low power and high performance CMOS devices such used to data centers, routers and terminals, together with the high-efficient DC power feeding technology. Another contribution of the CMOS technology is to save the total power consumption of any kinds of systems - from those for entire city transportation traffic to those for individual car operation - by the optimum power saving control of the operation by intelligent CMOS processors.

Thirdly, continuous progress of CMOS technology is critically important from the semiconductor industry point, and thus, from the global economical point of view as shown in Fig.1. Because of the merits in performance and power consumption from 65 to 45 nm node logic devices, and because of the high-density or

## III Summary of the results and conclusion

The individual research results of the group are described in detail in the papers included in this proceedings. It was shown that, in the Nano-CMOS era, aggressive introduction of new materials, processes, structures, and operation concepts will be required to solve the problems. La\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{3}\) based material is shown to be good candidates for high-k (high-dielectric constant) gate insulator to realize EOT (Equivalent Oxide Thickness) between 0.7 to 0. 5nm, which is believed to be very difficult to be realized by the current HfO\({}_{2}\) based materials (H. Iwai, S. Ohmi, K. Kakushima, and P. Ahmet), and La\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) thin gate film can have a good etching selectivity over Si during the RIE (Reactive etching) (J. Tonotani). Plasma doing was shown to be a good candidate of ultra-shallow doing technique with junction depth less than 10 nm (B. Mizuno, Y. Sasaki, K. Ttsutsui, H. Iwai). Varying threshold voltage between off- and on-stages by the back gate bias is known to be good method to reduce the off-leakage (subthreshold) current with keeping high performance of high on-drain current. This structure was demonstrated using a buried back-gate-electrode structure implemented into low k (dielectric constant) substrate SOI with insulator such as Benzocyclobutene (BCB) (M. Koyanagi, and T. Tanaka, and. T. Fukushima). It was found that mobility is enhanced both for electron (due to volume expansion) and holes (due to suppression of phonon scattering) in (110) ultra-thin-body SOI MOSFETs (H. Hiramoto and T. Saraya). It was pointed out that the dopant depletion in fine Si nanowire would become a problem for source/drain of Si nanowire MOSFETs (K. Yamada, A. Seike).

The advanced physical analysis techniques in order to explain the atomic scale phenomena and properties at the new material interfaces are becoming very important for the analysis and prediction of Nano CMOS. It was demonstrated that physical analysis such as XPS (X-ray Photo Luminescence) (T. Hattori and H. Nohira), RBS (Rutherford Back Scattering) (K. Kimura), and HR-TEM (High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscope) (N. Tanaka and and J. Yamasaki) are now very useful and hence, indispensable tools to analyze the interfacial property of Nano CMOS such as high-k gate dielectrics and Si-substrate. Several new phenomena were found by the analysis.

Theoretical analysis is another critically important issue to predict the current and future Nano CMOS behaviors. One dimensional semi-ballistic conduction of Nano CMOS was analyzed in detail by a new and straightforward method based on reflection-transmission (R-T) probabilities of scattering, and it has been confirmed that CNT (Carbon NanoTube) MOSFETs could be a good candidate for high performance CMOS with low power (K. Natori). New findings in nano-scale interface physics and atomistic behaviors of defects in gate dielectric materials were shown, and new mechanism of Fermi level pinning governed by the interface reaction was proposed (K. Shiraishi). By the analysis of Dielectric properties of ultra-thin films, based on first-principles ground-states calculations, it has been revealed that ultra-thin La\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) film having a thickness of 1.1 nm possesses a large value of the static dielectric constant equivalent to that of bulk (J. Nakamura, A. Natori). Fundamental theories for electronic properties of dielectric films based on the Rigged QED (Quantum ElectroDynamics) theory and the regional DFT (Density Functional Theory) were created for the analysis of high-k gate dielectrics for Nano CMOS (A. Tachibana, K. Doi).

So far, it became our consensus through the above research, that aggressive introduction of new materials such as high-k gate dielectrics, new processes such as plasma doping technique, and new structures such as back-gate SOI or Fin FETs will solve the downsizing problems until down to around 5 nm. Then, we have to think about the following five concerns for the integration of such small-geometry MOSFETs in a chip; 1) Integration of huge number of the ultra-small MOSFETs would consume too huge power and thus, creates too huge heat? 2) Integration of such ultra-small MOSFETs causes too huge variations in the transistor characteristics, which could make the circuit design impossible? 3)There are too many number of transistors in a chip for the circuit designers to manipulate? (design crisis), 4)There would be no merit of transistor downsizing in performance and power, because of RC (resistance capacitance product) of interconnect cannot be reduced aggressively any more? 5)Who will pay the huge development and production costs for the integration of such ultra-small MOSFETs? Note that the prices for the recent process equipments and the lithography mask became extremely high.

These concerns have been argued in the past 15 years at every new generation of the products, like the wolf boy. Fortunately, however, they have not come true, and it would be expected that we can go with several more generations for the integration. There will be still a room for squeezing the technologies to obtain the merit of the scaling-down for integration. For example, the main job of my PC is editing documents and accessing internet for e-mails. I do not think we need such high clock frequency above GHz and several tens watt just for such simple human editing works. There should be a clever way for saving the power of PC, considering the power saving of cellular phones.

Then, who will pay the huge development and production costs? Of course, the leading edge company will pay the cost to obtain the huge founders profit, like Intel, Samsung, Toshiba and TSMC. Otherwise they will drop off from the existent race, and the competitor will be very happy. The cost could be shared with world-wide group companies or consortium, depending on the finance condition of the companies. The number of thecompanies which can afford to pay the cost is decreasing at every new generation of the products and winning strategy for market is inevitable to survive the race. The second tier companies which do not develop the most advanced generation technologies could enjoy the reduced cost of the development and production in their matured stage, but would not obtain big profit. Also, they cannot be too late to proceed with the downsizing, because the third tier companies in China and other Asian developing countries will catch them up soon with much lower cost.

However, now, it has been predicted that the downsizing of MOSFETs would reach its limit probably about the gate length of 5 nm around the year of 2020. Why it is expected that about 5 nm is the limit of the downsizing? There are three main reasons; 1) Difficulty on off-current suppression: From the consideration of the integration of huge number of MOSFETs in a chip, and resulted huge entire off-leakage current, probably, around 5 nm could be regarded as the limit of the gate length reduction. It might be even 10 nm or 3 nm, depending on the number of MOSFET integrations. Below 3 nm, the direct-tunneling leakage current increases very significantly and it is almost impossible to suppress the off-leakage current, 2) Difficulty on increase in on-current: Already the conduction of the drain current enters in the semi-ballistic region and thus, no significant increase of the drain saturated current or on-current is expected by reducing the gate length below 5 nm. Also, increase in source/drain resistance of small geometry MOSFETs tends to suppress the on-current. 3) Difficulty on decrease in gate capacitance: One of the scaling merits is to reduce the gate capacitance, because the switching time of MOSFETs is defined by \(\mathrm{C_{g}V/I_{d}}\), where \(\mathrm{C_{g}}\) is the gate capacitance, V is the supply voltage and \(\mathrm{I_{d}}\) is the drain on-current. However, \(\mathrm{C_{g}}\) will not decrease in proportion to the gate length because of gate electrode sidewall capacitance component and that of drain/source and gate-electrode overlap. These capacitance components are very difficult to be reduced because the gate electrode thickness and source/drain depth are very difficult to be further decreased.

It is not sure exactly at what gate length and exactly at what year, the downsizing of MOSFETs reaches its limit, but most of the engineers are expecting that it would happen around at the gate length of 5 nm and around in the year of 2020, although it could be 10 nm in 2015 or 3 nm in 2030.

Then, what will be the world after we reach the limit? Unfortunately, among the proposed new-functional-mechanism logic devices - so-called 'beyond CMOS' devices -, there are no candidates which are believed to really replace CMOS transistors applicable in highly integrated circuits within 20 years. Our opinion is that we need to still continue CMOS based transistors with 'More Moore' approach with combining that of 'More than Moore.' Then, what is 'More Moore' approach after we reach the downsizing limit or when there is no more decrease in gate length? Because the number of the transistors in a chip is limited by the power consumption, we could continue the 'More Moore' law for certain period by replacing the current planar CMOS transistors by Si-nanowire or even carbon nanotube MOSFETs with which the suppression of off-leakage current and increase of on-current under low voltage could be realized due to its superior nature - such as good control of channel potential by surrounding gate electrode, quasi-one-dimensional conduction, multi- quantum channel per wire/tube and high-density integration of wire/tube in multi-layers.

Figure 2 shows expected scheme for the innovation after the downsizing of MOSFETs reaches its limit. Even after the downsizing reaches its limit, there will be continuous effort to improve the MOSFETs by introducing new materials, processes and structures. It should be noted that that the introduction of new materials to commercial products usually take more than 10 years from the 1\({}^{\mathrm{st}}\) presentations of academic papers at conferences, as we can see in those for HfO2 based high-k gate insulator, NiSi salicide, and Cu interconnects. 2020 would be too early for the materials used for logic CMOS and those for memories are completely optimized. Also, it would take more years for the technologies of Si nanowire and CNT FETs to become mature for production. Si nanowire FETs could be introduced to the production relatively earlier, because the fabrication process is similar to that of current planar type CMOS. However, there is no appropriate fabrication process for the integration of the CNT FET known, and thus, it will take much longer to introduce the CNT MOSFETs into the integrated circuits.

There are also other many works remaining. More than Moore approach - hybrid integration of many different kinds of devices on the mother chip or multi-chip integration - will become more and more important as the SOC (System On a Chip) integration. Three-dimensional integration of memory cells will become indispensable to proceed with the further higher integration of memories. Also, miniaturization of print circuits board should be done aggressively along with that of integrated circuit chips. Then, there will be a revolution for manufacturing methods for more economical production, when there is no need to develop new technologies for smaller dimension devices and hence no new equipments for downsizing. Do we need huge very-clean rooms - which consumes huge clean air, and hence, power - for the integrated circuits production? Maybe, it could be enough that only the inside of the process chamber of the equipment is very clean. What should be a silicon wafer for future? Do we need to continue to increase the wafer diameter from 300 to 450 mm and then, from 450 to 675 mm? Is the wafer necessary to be a single crystal for the entire area? There could be a possibility of replacing the current type of Si wafer by flat-panel type substrate used for LED (Light-Emitting Diode) in some future.

Other ways to further improve the system performance after the downsizing limit is the system architecture optimization and algorithm evolution. Compared with biological systems, such as human brain or even those as tiny as a mosquito, the performance per unit volume or per unit power is much higher than the modern electronic computer. However, no one knows how to realize such efficient systems today. It would take at least another 50 years when such an efficient biological system may be realized in the electronic way.
