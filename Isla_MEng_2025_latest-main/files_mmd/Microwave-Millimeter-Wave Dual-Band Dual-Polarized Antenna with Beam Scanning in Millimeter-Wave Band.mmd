## I Introduction

In order to adapt to the trend of miniaturization of wireless equipment, highly integrated cross-band multi-frequency antennas are one of the important development directions. In addition, when the communication signal propagates in the complex electromagnetic space, it will inevitably be reflected and refracted many times to produce multipath effects. Dual-polarized antennas can effectively reduce multipath effects. so the antenna with cross-band dual-polarization characteristics is very adaptable to the needs of future wireless communication systems.

Currently, the research on cross-band microwave and millimeter-wave shared-aperture antennas for structural multiplexing has already had some foundation. The end-fire dipole antenna in [1] serves as a microwave-band radiator, and the tapered slit between the dipoles serves as a millimeter-wave-band radiator. [2] utilizes the entire millimeter-wave SIW array antenna as a patch radiator for microwaves. In [3], Ka-band antenna acts as a parasitic loading to Ku-band antenna. [4] Hybridizes an X-band Fabry-Perot cavity antenna and a Ka-band folded transmitarray. [5] Embedding the high-frequency cylindrical dielectric resonators into the low-frequency annular cylindrical dielectric resonators. Only a few antennas have both dual-polarization and beam scanning capability. For example, [6] combined a low-frequency horn antenna with a millimeter-wave magneto-electric dipole antenna to achieve dual polarization in both frequency bands with a beam scan angle of \(\pm\)20\({}^{\circ}\). [7] achieves a scan angle of \(\pm\)50\({}^{\circ}\) in both Ka and Ku bands, but is only dual-polarized in the Ku band, Ka band is still single-polarized.

The microstrip triangular cavity has the advantages of small size, wide bandwidth and simple structure [8]. In this paper, based on [8], a beam-scanning shared-aperture antenna based on a 1\(\times\)3 microstrip triangular cavity subarray with dual polarization across frequency bands is proposed. In addition, the antenna has two polarizations, 0\({}^{\circ}\) and 90\({}^{\circ}\), in both frequency bands, and both polarizations have beam scanning characteristics in the millimeter-wave band. More importantly, the structural asymmetry present in the single-polarized dual-band antenna proposed in [8] is overcome by designing the arrangement of the antenna array.

## II Antenna Design

As shown in Fig.1, the cross-band dual-band dual-polarization multiplexed antenna based on a 1 \(\times\) 3 microstrip triangular cavity subarray mainly consists of a co-radiator structure for the microwave antenna and millimeter-wave antenna, a metal via hole, a ground plate, and a feed network operating in the two bands respectively. The antenna contains two substrates, a bonding layer, and three metal layers. The substrate 1 of thickness \(H_{1}\) and the substrate 2 of thickness \(H_{2}\) are both of Rogers 5880(\(\varepsilon\) = 2.2, tan\(\delta\) = 0.0009). The substrate 1 and the substrate 2 are connected by press-fit technology, and the bonding layer of thickness \(H_{b}\) is of model Rogers 6700(\(\varepsilon\) = 2.35, tan\(\delta\) = 0.0025). The copper cladding thickness of all metal layers is 0.018 mm. It can be seen that the antenna has a total of eight millimeter wave ports (Port1-Port8) and two microwave ports (Port9 and Port10).

In the top view of Fig. 1(b), each co-radiator structure is obtained by the mirror symmetry of two 1\(\times\)3 millimeter-wave microstrip triangular cavity subarrays with a spacing of \(L_{w}\), which are fed by microwave probes with radius \(R_{2}\) on the symmetry line. The lower layer of substrate 2 has eight millimeter-wave feed lines of width \(W_{f}\) loaded with high-pass filters (HPFs), each of which is connected to the millimeter-wave probes, allowing the co-radiator structure to resonate as a cascaded triangular cavity in the millimeter-wave band.

## III Experimental Results and Discussion

In order to verify the feasibility of this design, we processed this cross-band dual-band dual-polarized antenna, and the photograph of the physical figure is shown in Fig. 2, where two substrates can be seen to be pressed together through the adhesive layer. Two SMA connectors are soldered on both sides of the substrate to feed microwave ports 9 and 10, respectively, while eight SMPM connectors are soldered around the substrate to feed millimeter-wave ports (ports 1 to 8), respectively.

### _Performance in the Microwave Band_

The E field distributions of the antenna when port 9 and port 10 are excited are given in Fig. 3, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3(a), it can be seen that when port 10 is excited, the E field distribution of the antenna at 3.26 GHz is similar to the TM10 mode of the half-wavelength patch antenna, and the direction of the E field is parallel to the x-axis, and at this time, the microwave segment polarization mode is 0\({}^{\circ}\) polarization. In Fig. 3(b), when port 9 excitation, in 3.25GHz antenna is also similar to the patch antenna TM10 mode to work, but then the E field direction is parallel to the y-axis, so port 9 excitation microwave segment polarization mode for 90 \({}^{\circ}\) polarization.

The simulated and measured S-parameter curves for the two microwave ports are given in Fig. 4. It can be observed that the impedance matching bandwidth of the measured matches the simulation results and the isolation between ports 9 and 10 is higher than 30 dB. From the E field distribution in Fig. 3, it can also be noticed that when the microwave port is excited, the electric field on the millimeter-wave feedline is weaker.

The simulated and measured gain and radiation efficiency curves of the antenna are shown in Fig. 5. When port 9 is excited, the corresponding simulated gain average is 5.6 dBi, while the measured gain average is 4.8 dBi, and the radiation efficiencies are 80% and 69% for simulation and measured, respectively. When port 10 is excited, the simulated and measured peak gains are 6 and 5.2 dBi, respectively, and the simulated and measured radiation efficiencies are 79% and 71%, respectively. In Fig. 6, the respective normalized radiation patterns under port 9 and port 10 are shown in Fig. 7.

10 excitation are given, and it can be seen that the simulated and measured radiation patterns are in good agreement, and both of them have the direction diagram characteristics similar to that of the patch antenna. In the axial direction of the beam, the cross-polarization levels of the simulated and measured E-plane and H-plane are higher than 25 and 18 dB, respectively.

### _Performance in the MM-Wave Band_

The E field distribution of the antenna at 26.5 GHz is shown in Fig. 7, where ports 1, 2, 3, and 4 are excited at the same time in Fig. 7(a), and ports 5, 6, 7, and 8 are excited at the same time in Fig. 7(b), and the phase difference between the feed ports is kept at 180\({}^{\circ}\) intervals in both excitation modes. From Fig. 7(a), it can be seen that the antenna operates with a 4 \(\times\) 3 triangular cavity array in the millimeter band, and the E field direction is parallel to the x-axis direction, so the polarization in the millimeter band is 0\({}^{\circ}\) polarization when ports 1, 2, 3, and 4 are excited. In Fig. 7(b), it can be clearly found that the E field direction is parallel to the y-axis in this state, so the millimeter-band antenna is polarized at 90\({}^{\circ}\) when ports 5, 6, 7, and 8 are excited.

The simulated and measured reflection coefficients of the antenna in the millimeter band are given in Fig. 8. The simulated bandwidth of -10 dB relative impedance bandwidths for 0\({}^{\circ}\) and 90\({}^{\circ}\) polarization overlap with the simulated bandwidth at 9.8% (25.78-28.44 GHz), the measured value is 10.5% (25.65-28.49 GHz).

In Fig. 9, the orientation of the antenna unit in the plane at 27 GHz when ports 1 and 2 are excited respectively, and the orientation of the antenna unit in the plane when ports 5 and 6 are excited respectively are given. As shown in Fig. 9, it can be seen that the gain 3 dB beam scan range is -27\({}^{\circ}\)-28\({}^{\circ}\) for 0\({}^{\circ}\) polarization, and the slight asymmetry is due to the asymmetry

of the microwave feed structure. The 3 dB beam scan range for 90\({}^{\circ}\) polarization is -25\({}^{\circ}\)-23\({}^{\circ}\), and the difference in beam scan range between the two polarizations is mainly due to the inconsistency of the microwave feed structure adopted in both polarizations.

## IV Conclusion

A dual-band dual-polarized beam-scanning antenna for sub-6G and millimeter bands is proposed. Two 1\(\times\)3 subarrays are arranged by mirroring and fed by 180\({}^{\circ}\) phase difference, and then the 2\(\times\)3 subarrays are replicated by 180\({}^{\circ}\) and 90\({}^{\circ}\) rotation to form a dual-polarized 4\(\times\)3 array. In addition, the whole array can be used as a half-wavelength patch antenna in the microwave band. Measurement results show that dual-polarization performance is achieved in both frequency bands and the scanning angles are - 27\({}^{\circ}\)-28\({}^{\circ}\) (0\({}^{\circ}\) pol) and -25\({}^{\circ}\)-23\({}^{\circ}\) (90\({}^{\circ}\) pol) in the millimeter-wave band.
