## I Introduction

In the last two decades, organic semiconductors have been intensively studied as novel materials for optoelectronics. They combine the simple processing of plastics with electronic function and efficient light emission. They have been applied across the spectrum of optoelectronic devices, including organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) [1], [2], photovoltaics [3], transistors [4], optical amplifiers [5]-[9], and lasers [10]-[21]. Their unique combination of properties has enabled new device geometries and processing techniques, leading, for example, to printable optoelectronics. The main research focus has been on OLEDs for light-emitting displays; these are now commercially available, and their considerable success makes the wider study of the use of these materials for other light-emitting devices a promising field of study.

Organic semiconductors are particularly appealing as novel laser gain media [21]. They have four-level energy systems in which vibrational and structural relaxations separate the absorption and emission bands. Strong optical transitions (peak absorbance of 10\({}^{5}\) cm\({}^{-1}\) and emission cross-section \(\sim\)10\({}^{-16}\) cm\({}^{2}\)) give the potential for large optical gain in very compact devices. Like conventional laser dyes, organic semiconductors are broadband emitters; and, through simple changes in chemical structure, the emission may be tuned across the visible spectrum. However, unlike conventional dyes, they show little concentration quenching and can have fluorescence quantum efficiencies greater than 90% in undiluted films. Consequently, organic semiconductors are very well suited for compact tunable lasers and broadband optical amplifiers.

All organic semiconductor lasers and optical amplifiers are currently optically pumped, meaning that another light source is needed to excite the organic semiconductor. There has been good progress in developing miniature systems, and pulsed microchip lasers are now routinely used to drive broadly tunable organic distributed feedback lasers [15], [16], [22], [23]. There also have been several demonstrations of organic semiconductor lasers pumped by nitride diode lasers [24]-[26], and even an LED-pumped polymer laser [27]. Furthermore, the semiconducting properties of these materials give a prospect in the longer term for electrically pumped organic semiconductor lasers and amplifiers [21], [21]. Organic lasers have been extensively reviewed over the years [11], [13], [14], [21], so this paper will focus on the newer field of organic semiconductor optical amplifiers (OSOAs).

Optical amplifiers are devices that amplify optical signals in a single transit though the device and are very useful in communications networks. They are needed to compensate the reduction of signal strength due to splitting and transmission losses. Wide-area communications networks are currently based on silica fibers, and such networks transmit at high bandwidths of more than 1 Gb/s. These high bandwidths are not currently available to homes and officesbecause transmission from the remote station to local-area networks (LANs) uses copper wires (twisted pair or coaxial cables), which have a limited bandwidth and create a bottleneck at remote stations [28]. Installing silica fiber networks from the remote stations to LANs would not be cost-effective, as it would require thousands of fibers, which would become very expensive [29]. Polymer optical fibers (POFs) are an economical alternative offering high bandwidth at low cost [28], [29]. They are simple to install and can be installed on site. A bundle of POF is more flexible than a bundle of silica fibers [29] and hence suitable for the harsh environments in urban areas. OSOAs would be compatible with POF, as their emission wavelength is well matched to the transmission windows of POF.

The optical transitions of most dyes and conjugated polymers fall in the visible region of the spectrum. Accordingly most organic light-emitting devices also operate in the visible. There is a limitation on the smallest energy gap that can be achieved arising from the Peierls distortion [30]; a conjugated polymer would potentially be a one-dimensional metal, but such a metal is unstable to a dimerization, which opens an energy gap and so leads to semiconducting behavior. This wavelength range can be extended (though with limited efficiency) by blending with materials such as erbium tris(quinolate) [31] or semiconductor quantum dots [32], [33]. Dye-doped polymers have been extensively studied as solid-state amplifiers, but conjugated polymers offer advantages in terms of the much higher chromophore concentrations that can be achieved without concentration quenching [10], [24], which allow high photoluminescence yield even in neat films and have the future possibility of electrical excitation [21].

## II Electronic structure and optical properties

In organic semiconductors, like their inorganic counterparts, the semiconducting properties arise from the overlap of atomic orbitals. In conjugated molecules (those that have alternating single and double bonds), three of the four valence electrons of carbon typically make covalent \(\sigma\)-bonds with neighboring atoms in the plane of the molecule. The fourth electron is in a p\({}_{z}\) orbital, which is oriented perpendicular to the plane of the molecule. Overlap of these orbitals leads to covalent \(\pi\)-bonding and electron delocalization along the molecule, as illustrated in Fig. 1[34], [35], and this in turn leads to semiconducting electronic properties. Molecular orbitals formed of p\({}_{z}\) atomic orbitals can be bonding (\(\pi\)) or anti-bonding (\(\pi^{*}\)). Usually, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) has two electrons in the bonding \(\pi\)-orbital. One of these can be excited to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), which is an antibonding \(\pi^{*}\) orbital. Optical transitions between HOMO and LUMO determine the lowest energy absorption and luminescence properties in organic materials. Hole transport occurs by hopping between HOMOs of neighboring molecules, whereas transport of electrons is by hopping between the LUMOs of neighboring molecules. While the HOMO and LUMO are analogous to the valence and conduction bands of inorganic semiconductors, it is only in the most ordered organic semiconductors that band-like transport is possible. Most organic semiconductors are much more disordered than inorganic semiconductors leading to hopping transport.

Organic laser dyes are also conjugated molecules, which can give optical gain upon optical excitation in solution or when dispersed in an inert matrix. The advantages of conjugated polymers are that they can have high photoluminescence quantum yields even as neat films, thereby enabling very high optical gain in solid state; their scope for simple fabrication of waveguides; and the future prospect of electrical pumping [14], [21], [36].

A photon of energy equal to or greater than the difference in energy between the HOMO and LUMO can be absorbed by the material and will excite a molecule from the ground state S\({}_{0}\) to a singlet excited state. The lowest singlet excited state is called S\({}_{1}\), and higher lying singlets are S\({}_{2}\), S\({}_{3}\), etc. Each electronic state has many vibrational levels

Figure 1: _Illustration of the p\({}_{z}\)-orbitals above and below the plane of polyacetylene. The overlap of p\({}_{z}\)-orbitals gives molecular \(\pi\)-orbitals, which are conjugated along the polymer chain._

Figure 2: _Optical transitions between the vibrational energy levels of the ground (s\({}_{z}\)) state and the lowest singlet excited state (s\({}_{z}\)) responsible for photon absorption and emission (solid arrows). vibrational relaxation in s\({}_{z}\) shown by a dashed arrow is a radiation-less process._

(indicated as 0, 1, and 2 in Fig. 2). Before absorption of the photon, almost all molecules are in the zero vibrational level of the S\({}_{0}\) state because the spacing between vibrational levels is much larger than a thermal energy. Absorption occurs to one of the vibrational energy levels of the singlet excited state depending on photon energy. Following absorption, relaxation to the zero vibrational energy level of S\({}_{1}\) state occurs predominantly within 1 ps [37]. Photon emission (spontaneous or stimulated by an external photon) occurs from the lowest vibrational level of the S\({}_{1}\) state to each of the vibrational levels of the ground state S\({}_{0}\).

Fig. 3 shows chemical structures of some conjugated macromolecules (four polymers and a first-generation dendrimer), which have been used to demonstrate high gain optical amplifiers in solution [Fig. 3(a)-(c)] and in the solid state [Fig. 3(b), (d), and (e)]. Fig. 4 shows the absorption and spontaneous emission spectra of the conjugated polymer OC\({}_{1}\)C\({}_{10}-\)PPV. The emission spectrum shows peaks at 560 and 600 nm together with a shoulder at 650 nm. These features correspond to optical transitions from the lowest vibrational level of the S\({}_{1}\) state to the 0, 1, and 2 vibrational levels of the S\({}_{0}\) state, respectively. In absorption spectra, this structure is hidden by inhomogeneous broadening [38].

Amplification in OSOAs, like other materials, is obtained by stimulated emission. As in laser dyes, the

Figure 3: **Chemical structures of some organic semiconducting materials used for amplifiers (a) OC\({}_{1}\)C\({}_{10}\)-PPV, (b) F8BT, (c) biftuorene-cored first generation dendrimer, (d) MEM-PPV, and (e) AD523IVE.**

relevant transition is from S\({}_{1}\) to S\({}_{0}\). It is stimulated by an incident photon; as a result, another photon is emitted of the same frequency and direction as the stimulating photon. For small signals, the intensity of the optical signal increases exponentially with distance \(z\)[13, 21, 39]

\[I=I_{0}\exp^{(g-\alpha)z} \tag{1}\]

where \(I_{0}\) is the initial intensity, \(\alpha\) is the extinction coefficient due to absorption and scattering, and \(g\) is the gain coefficient. The latter is expressed by [13, 14]

\[g=\sigma N \tag{2}\]

where \(N\) is the population density of S\({}_{1}\) state and \(\sigma\) is the gain cross-section. These parameters can be obtained from transient absorption spectroscopy [40, 41, 42, 43] or by using amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) measurements using the variable stripe length (VSL) method, as demonstrated by McGehee _et al._[44]. The presence of ASE indicates that the gain is more than the absorption, i.e., that \(g\) is greater than \(\alpha\). Xia _et al._, for instance, used the VSL method on a number of conjugated polymers: poly(9,9-dioctyllfluorene) (PFO), red-F, and poly(9,9-dioctyllfluorene-co-benzothidiazole) (F8BT) [45, 46]. The measurements gave gain cross-sections on the order of \(10^{-16}\) cm\({}^{2}\); net gain \(g-\alpha\) of 74, 24, and 22 cm\({}^{-1}\); and waveguiding losses \(\alpha\) of 3.5, 3.2, and 7.6 cm\({}^{-1}\). These values are of the same order of magnitude as reported for other conjugated polymers [15, 18, 47]. In optical amplifiers described in this paper, gain is determined by

\[\mathrm{G(dB)}=10\log\left[\frac{I_{\mathrm{on}}-I_{\mathrm{b}}}{I_{\mathrm{ off}}}\right] \tag{3}\]

where \(I_{\mathrm{on}}\) is the intensity of the amplified signal, \(I_{\mathrm{b}}\) is background luminescence (typically \(I_{\mathrm{b}}<0.01\) of \(I_{\mathrm{on}}\)), and \(I_{\mathrm{off}}\) is the signal intensity without pump.

## III Solution-based amplifiers

### Conjugated Polymers as Gain Media

Although the presence of the gain in optically pumped solutions of organic semiconductors has been observed using transient absorption and VSL techniques, it was not until recently that large amplification was reported in a conjugated polymer [8, 9]. A solution of poly[2-methoxy-5-(3\({}^{\prime}\),7\({}^{\prime}\)-dimethyloctyloxy)-paraphenylenevinylene] (OC\({}_{1}\)C\({}_{10}\)-PPV; Fig. 4) in chlorobenzene in a 1 cm quartz cuvette was excited with laser pulses in ultraviolet. The pump beam was focused into a stripe using a cylindrical lens. Amplification of the weak signal pulse was monitored with a power meter placed after the sample; some of the results are shown in Fig. 5. A maximum gain of 30-43 dB was achieved over a tuning range of about 50 THz. This result showed not only that conjugated polymers are capable of amplifying light pulses by several orders of magnitude but also that they could do so over a broad spectral range. In fact, the range of wavelengths reported was limited not by the conjugated polymer but by the tuning range of the dye laser used to generate the test signal that was amplified. Fig. 5 also shows the effect of concentration on the gain: at low concentrations, not enough of the pump light is absorbed in the region of the signal beam, whereas at high concentration, the pump light is absorbed in a region much smaller than the signal beam, so that the highest gain is at intermediate concentration.

The variation of gain with the input energy \(E_{\mathrm{in}}\) was measured and is shown in Fig. 5(b). The solid line is a theoretical fit to the gain of an optical amplifier [48]

\[G=\frac{A}{C_{3}}\mathrm{ln}\left[1+G_{0}\left[\exp\left(\frac{C_{3}}{A} \right)-1\right]\right] \tag{4}\]

where

\[C_{3}=\frac{E_{\mathrm{in}}(\sigma_{\mathrm{abs}}+\sigma_{\mathrm{se}})}{h \nu_{\mathrm{in}}} \tag{5}\]

and \(G_{0}\) is the small signal gain, i.e., the unsaturated gain obtained with a weak signal energy; \(A\) is the cross-sectional area of the signal; \(\sigma_{\mathrm{abs,se}}\) is the absorption and stimulated emission cross-section, \(h\) is Planck's constant; and \(v_{\mathrm{in}}\) is the signal frequency. The saturation energy \(E_{\mathrm{sat}}\) is defined as the input energy at which gain is 25% of the \(G_{0}\) value. From the fit, a small signal gain of 44 dB and \(E_{\mathrm{sat}}=1~{}\mu\)l are obtained. The gain cross-section was calculated to

Figure 4: **(left) Absorption and (right) emission spectra and molecule structure of OC\({}_{i}\)c\({}_{uv}\)-PPV. (Revised with permission from [8]J)**

be \(=(5.3\pm 0.6)\times 10^{-17}\) cm\({}^{2}\) using both (2) (calculating only in the range of low pump energy densities) and (5) (assuming that the absorption at the probing wavelength to be negligible, hence \(\sigma_{\mathrm{abs}}=0\)), which is expected for high-gain conjugated polymers [13], [14]. The increase in the gain at the edges of the tuning range (575, 640 nm) is due to lower energy in the signal pulse due to its being at the edge of the tuning range of the dye laser generation.

The conjugated copolymer F8BT, shown in Fig. 3(b), has been used as a gain medium in solution [9] and solid-state [7] amplifiers as well as in polymer lasers [18]. Solution amplifiers showed the gain in excess of 30 dB over the spectral range from 535 to 570 nm [Fig. 6(a)]. An apparent increase of the gain towards shorter wavelengths at high concentrations could be due to reduction of the ground state absorption in the excited sample. Fig. 6(b) shows the gain variation with the signal pulse energy for a concentration of 3 mg/ml. Equation (5) was fitted to the experimental data and gave a small signal gain of 28 dB and a saturation signal energy of 0.6 \(\mu\)J. The gain cross-section of (1.7 \(\pm\) 0.1) \(\times\) 10\({}^{-16}\) cm\({}^{2}\) was determined from the fit, which is comparable to other values reported for [46], [49], and [50].

### Dendrimers

Optical amplification has also been reported in another class of organic semiconductor, namely, conjugated dendrimers. These branched macromolecules consist of a core, dendrons, and surface groups, and their modular molecular architecture gives considerable scope for tuning their properties [21, 51]. The scope for optical amplification was studied in a first-generation bishfluorene-cored dendrimer, which had previously proved useful for deep blue organic light-emitting diodes [52]. This dendrimer consists of a bishfluorene unit to which two G1 triphenyl-based dendrons with 2-ethyl-hexyloxy surface groups are attached and is shown in Fig. 3(c). The dendrimer was dissolved in toluene to a concentration of 0.31 g/l and found to give strong optical amplification in the deep blue and near ultraviolet regions of the spectrum [53]. Maximum gains of 36 and 26 dB were achieved with signal wavelengths of 420 and 390 nm, respectively, and the results are shown in Fig. 7. The gain cross-section was calculated using (2) to be \(=3.4\times 10^{-18}\) cm\({}^{2}\).

### Comparison With Laser Dyes

Laser desyhase been used for amplification of light pulses for many years [48, 54, 55]. The main limitation is that the dye concentration should be kept low to avoid concentration quenching due to aggregation of dye molecules [13]. Ramon _et al._ have reported optical amplification in excess of 30 dB in a solution of Rhodamine 640 with a 1 cm path length [56]. Gain of 30 dB and higher was obtained for signal pulse energy not exceeding 100 nJ.

Fig. 8 summarizes the gain values achieved in solution-based amplifiers, which use organic semiconductors [8, 9, 53] and laser dyes [56, 57]. Organic semiconductors show high gain over a wider bandwidth than laser dyes. More parameters for these amplifiers are compared in Table 1, including the saturation energy for the signal pulse, which indicates that light pulses with input energy up to 1 \(\mu\)J can be efficiently amplified in both classes of materials. Absence of concentration quenching in organic semiconductors gives the potential to achieve high gain in a shorter path length than laser dyes. While all the OSOAs described in this paper are pulsed, the results do indicate the potential of conjugated polymers and dendrimers for broadband amplifying devices.

## IV Solid-State Amplifiers

The solution-based semiconducting amplifier results are very encouraging, but for practical applications a solid-state amplifier is preferable. This presents additional challenges.

1. Compared to the solution-based experiments, the pump and probe beams overlap over a smaller volume.
2. The higher chromophore density in films could result in some concentration quenching.
3. Coupling into solid-state organic compounds is an issue, as they do not cleave well and require efficient device structures.

### Amplification in Semiconducting Polymer Waveguides

The feasibility of solid-state polymer amplifiers was explored using slab waveguides made of the polymer layer, which was spin-coated on top of a silica substrate as shown in Fig. 9. Gratings were used to couple light into and out of the polymer layer. They were defined using electron-beam lithography on polymethyl methacrylate

Figure 8: **Maximum gain as a function of signal wavelength in solution amplifiers using a bishfluorene-cored first-generation dendrimer (open circles), F8BT (open squares), OC,C\({}_{10}\)-PPV (solid circles), and a laser dye Rhodamine 640 (solid squares).**

Figure 7: ** Gain dependence on the signal pulse energy at 430 nm for a bishfluorene-cored conjugated dendrimer in solution. (Reused with permission from [53].)**and then transferred into the substrate using reactive ion etching. Solid-state amplifiers were demonstrated using commercially available polymers: poly[2-methoxy-5-(_2'_-ethylhexyloxy)-_p_-phenylene-vinylene] (MEH-PPV), F8BT, and ADS233YE from American Dye Source Inc. as well as Red-F from Sumitomo Chemical Co.

Fig. 10 shows some results from the MEH-PPV solid-state amplifier, which showed small signal gain of up to 21 dB in a waveguide 1 mm long [6]. Gain cross-section of 4 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-17}\) cm\({}^{2}\) was obtained using (2) in the low pump energy density region, and gain saturation was observed at high pump densities. Gain dynamics was studied, which showed that gain saturation occurs due to exciton-exciton annihilation and ASE [6]. Exciton-excition annihilation is a process in which two excitons within the annihilation radius and form a higher excited state, leading to the loss of one of them. It is a bimolecular process, and the rate constant was found to be 3 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-9}\) cm\({}^{3}\)/s, which is similar to that reported in films of other conjugated polymers [58, 59, 60]. Gain dependence on the signal pulse energy shown in the inset of Fig. 10 demonstrates that the population inversion with moderate pump densities supports amplification of input light pulses with energy up to 30 nJ. This polymer amplifier also showed gain of 15 dB at wavelengths of 615 and 650 nm, giving a gain bandwidth \(>\) 26 THz.

Fig. 11 shows gain properties in slab waveguides of the copolymer Red-F [61]. The longest waveguide used in the work described in this paper was only 0.3 mm long and showed gain of 18 dB. This is just slightly lower than that observed in the 1 mm MEH-PPV waveguide and indicates that the diluted nature of low-energy chromophores in copolymers can improve gain properties. This indeed has been confirmed in a recent study of gain in waveguides of a copolymer ADS233YE, which has shown a maximum gain of 32 dB in a 1-mm-long waveguide [62]. These very high gains in very short distances show the potential of conjugated polymers for compact optical amplifiers.

## Appendix B Amplification of Multiple Pulses

As data communication is implemented using streams of light pulses, it is important to investigate the feasibility of amplifying pulse sequences. This is challenging because in early conjugated polymer amplifiers, the gain lifetime was very short at high pump energy densities. It has been explored using three pulses in a 140 ps window in a semiconducting polymer waveguide [7]. Some of the

results are presented in Fig. 12(a), which shows a gain of 24 dB for the first pulse and a slightly lower amplification of 18 and 13 dB for the second and third pulses, respectively, due to natural decay of the excited state population. Gain dependence on signal pulse energy presented in Fig. 12(b) shows that even amplification of three pulses is possible, with each of them having an input energy up to 0.1 nJ. Amplification of light pulses in a longer time window potentially could be achieved using a long pump pulse, which has not yet been demonstrated.

### Comparison With Dye and Rare-Earth Ion Doped Polymer Waveguides

Apart from organic semiconductors, the other promising gain media matching the transparency windows of the polymer optical fiber (500-560 and \(\sim\)660 nm) are dye-doped and rare-earth ion doped polymer waveguides and fibers. In these systems, the chromophores are suspended in an optically passive insulating polymer matrix.

We next consider the progress on dye-doped waveguide amplifiers. As mentioned earlier, end coupling into polymers is difficult because organic waveguides do not cleave well. Reilly _et al._ have worked around this by using a ribbed waveguide structure [63]. The waveguide structure was 1.2 cm long and 120 \(\mu\)m wide and consisted of a germanium doped silica layer deposited on a silica substrate. The doped silica layer was etched into 10-\(\mu\)m-deep waveguides. The laser dye Rhodamine 640 was dispersed in poly(methacrylate) (PMMA) at 1% by weight [63] and spin coated on top to form a 1-\(\mu\)m-thick layer. It was pumped with 10 ns pulses at 575 nm, with a repetition rate of 10 Hz, and the signal wavelength was 625 nm. The beams were combined and coupled into the silica waveguide. The light in the waveguide was coupled into the higher refractive index organic layer [63]. A maximum gain of 26 dB with a signal energy of 4 nJ was achieved with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the range of 9-16 dB.

A second dye-doped polymer waveguide device used by Reilly _et al._ consisted of the photoresist SU8 spin coated on a 7-\(\mu\)m-thick silica layer and patterned into 100 \(\mu\)m waveguide structures [57]. SU8 was a simple solution to provide low loss waveguides. The light was confined in the SU8 waveguides, and an evanescent wave was coupled into the polymer layer and amplified [57]. A maximum gain of 16 dB was obtained with an SNR in the range of 15 to 4 dB.

A dye doped solid state amplifier using pyromethene 650 (P650) suspended in a PMMA matrix was demonstrated by Lam _et al._[64]. A film of the active material was

spin-coated on a substrate, and maximum gains of up to 25 dB were obtained for a signal wavelength of 616 nm. Results for organic semiconductor and dye doped waveguide amplifiers are summarized in Table 2. These two types of amplifiers show similar gain; however, organic semiconductor amplifiers are more compact, operate at the higher pulse repetition rate, and have a broader gain bandwidth.

As mentioned earlier, VSL measurements have also been used to determine the gain coefficients. Several measurements have been conducted on dyes; to name a few: 1,4-bis[2-[4-[N,N-di(p-tolyl)amino]phenyl]vinyl]benzene (B2080), 2-[7-(1,3-dihydro-1,3,3-trimethyl-2H-indol-2-ylidene)-1,3,5-heptatrienyl]-1,3,3-trimethyl-3H-indolium iodide (NK-125), Rhodamine 640, and Coumarin 540. Gain coefficients of greater than 50 cm\({}^{-1}\) were obtained [65, 66, 67].

Research has been carried out on dye-doped fiber lasers [68, 69, 70] as well as dye-doped fiber amplifiers [71, 72, 73, 74, 75]. However, as this is a review on amplifiers, we will focus on dye-doped optical fiber amplifiers. These devices have been made by doping POP or graded index POP [71, 72] with dye molecules [72, 73, 74, 75]. Various organic dyes have been used: 4-Dicyanomethylene-2-methyl-6-(_p_-dimethylaminostyryl)-4H-pyran (DCM) [71], Oxazine 4 perchlorate (O4PC) [71], Rhodamine 6G [71], and Rhodamine B [71, 72], with Rhodamine being the most commonly used dye. Amplification was demonstrated with pump probe experiments, with the signal wavelength close to the low loss window of PMMA [71, 74]. Maximum gains in the range of 20-35 dB/m have been achieved [71, 72, 73]. Parameters and results are given in Table 3. A very large amplification of 18 dB in an 8-cm-long fiber amplifier was obtained by Rajesh _et al._ using Rhodamine 6G to a dye concentration of 1 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-3}\) M [74]. The values indicate the gain capability of dye-doped material in centimeters of fiber length.

Continuous wave or high repetition rate operation is problematic for laser dyes because of the accumulation of triplet excitations, which introduce losses. As an alternative, rare-earth ions have been used as gain media in polymer optical fibers [76, 77, 78, 79, 80]. They build on the success of erbium-doped silica-based fiber amplifiers, which have successfully been used in silica fiber networks. In these

Table 3: Parameters and Results for Dye-Doped Fiber Amplifiersmaterials, optical gain occurs on atomic transitions, giving much narrower linewidth and hence smaller gain bandwidth than molecular materials. Rare-earth ions can be encapsulated with organic ligands to improve their compatibility with a polymer matrix, so that it can be doped to higher concentrations than in silica [77, 78] to make compact devices. A gain of 5.7 dB was reported at 613 nm in a 30-cm-length step-index polymer optical fiber doped with europium [76]. Gains of up to 7 dB/cm [79] have been achieved with erbium-doped polymer-based fiber amplifiers. Other rare earth metals, such as neodymium, have been investigated as well and given a gain of 1.6 dB/cm [80].

Fig. 13 gives a summary of gain demonstrated in organic solid-state amplifiers. Organic semiconductors show much higher gain per unit length, and the devices are more compact than doped fiber amplifiers. We note that transmission and coupling losses are not included in this comparison, as the purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of gain properties.

## V All-optical switching of gain

All-optical switches are very desirable for high-speed telecommunications networks, integrated circuits, and signal processing. They would allow high-speed optical signal switching and wavelength switching. They have largely been researched by exploiting the third-order nonlinearity \(\chi^{(3)}\) of materials [81, 82, 83, 84, 85]; however, the success of such an approach is limited by material absorption. If the absorption coefficient \(\alpha_{0}\) is high, there would not be sufficient intensity to produce the required nonlinear phase shift. Due to this, there has been a long search for materials with a high optical nonlinearity and a low absorption coefficient [82, 83, 84, 85, 86]. This has been analyzed by Stegeman and coworkers to give a figure of merit (FOM) [85]

\[\text{FOM}=\frac{n_{2}I}{\lambda_{\text{vac}}\sum\alpha_{n}I^{n-1}} \tag{6}\]

where \(n_{2}\) is the intensity-dependent refractive index and \(S\alpha_{n}I^{n-1}\) is the total absorption with \(n=1,2,3\), etc. corresponding to linear, two photon, three photon absorption, and so on. The figure of merit has to be greater than one in order for the material to be able to provide the required nonlinear phase shift [85], and it has proved very challenging to meet this condition.

An alternative to this is resonant switching, which uses a control pulse matched in frequency to the excited state absorption. The principle was demonstrated in organic semiconducting films by optical change in the signal transmission. Frolov _et al._ demonstrated "dumping" of the gain in PPV films [87]. Virgili _et al._ investigated the possibility of switching the gain in a transient absorption experiment on isolated and densely packed PFO chains in PMMA films [88, 89].

### All-Optical Switching Using an Amplifier

An all-optical switch capable of amplifying as well as switching optical pulses, and that is cheap and easy to manufacture, would have many applications. We have explored this using resonant switching. The material used was a copolymer, which consisted of fluorene and benzothiadiazole units and was spin-coated to a 600-nm-thick polymer layer on a grating substrate. The absorption and emission spectra are shown in Fig. 14. The experiment used three beams called the pump, the signal, and the control. The pump was used to excite the material and amplify the weak signal pulse, as shown in Fig. 15(a). The control pulse moved excitations to a higher excited state, thereby

Figure 13: **(a) upper panel shows gain demonstrated in solid-state amplifiers using semiconducting polymer waveguides (open symbols) [(d), (PI, [d1]), dye-doped polymer waveguides (half-filled squares) [(S1), (S1) and fibers (solid symbols) [(PI, [d2]), and rare-earth doped polymer fibers (crosses) [(Dc), (Pc), (S0)] as a function of signal wavelength. (b) the lower panel shows the gain obtained per \(\sigma\) can length of the waveguide or fiber used.**

switching off the amplification of the signal beam, shown in Fig. 15(b). The pump, signal, and control pulses were applied at 5 kHz with 10 ps pulses at wavelengths of 497, 580, and 800 nm, respectively. The amplified pulse was switched off (reduced to a third of its intensity) on applying a 1 \(\mu\)] control pulse. This result is shown in Fig. 16. The amplification of the center pulse was switched off without affecting the neighboring pulses. On blocking the control pulse, the amplified signal recovered. In a transient absorption experiment, the recovery of the gain dynamics was obtained to be 2 ps, which defines a maximum possible switching rate of 500 GHz. The recovery dynamics are shown in Fig. 17 and were fitted to a biexponential fit with time constants of 50 fs and 1 ps. The ultrafast and full recovery is an encouraging result in contrast to a transient absorption study of PFO, where the incomplete recovery was due to the formation of interchain charge pairs, which were long lived [88]. The rapid recovery we obtained indicated that there was no formation of interchain charge pairs. Moreover, given that the dynamics did not fit to a \(\mathrm{t}^{-1/2}\) power law, which is a predicted dynamic for geminate recombination [88], it indicated that the switching effect was not due to geminate intrachain charge pairs and was due to excitation to the upper excited state.

### All-Optical Switching Using a Laser

All-optical switching using a similar mechanism has also been demonstrated in conjugated polymer lasers [90],

[91]]. The semiconducting materials used were Red-F and F8BT, operated at 5 and 1 kHz, respectively [90, 91]. For Red-F, the lasing wavelength was 650 nm and the control pulse was at 1.3 \(\mu\)m. Such devices therefore have the potential to be used as wavelength converters from 1.3 \(\mu\)m to 650 nm, which would be useful for converting signals from silica to polymer fibers.

The Red-F laser was optically pumped with 4 ps pulses at 492 and 498 nm and modulated with control pulses at 1.28 and 1.32 \(\mu\)m, respectively. Full switching of the lasing output was obtained with a strong pump and weak control pulse energy of 40 nJ and 2 \(\mu\)J, respectively, for a pump wavelength of 492 nm, shown in Fig. 18(a). Switching was also obtained with a pump energy of 200 nJ and a control pulse energy of 46 nJ, as shown in Fig. 18(b). This result showed that switching can even be obtained with a weak control pulse. Resonant laser switching was also demonstrated using the semiconducting polymer F8BT with 200 fs pulses. The pump and control wavelengths were 400 and 780 nm, respectively. Substantial switching was obtained with a control energy of 860 nJ, shown in Fig. 19.

## VI Conclusion

Lasing and ASE have been explored in semiconducting conjugated polymer films for just over a decade. However, the field of semiconducting conjugated polymer amplifier _devices_ is a much newer field. They have demonstrated gains per unit length of 21-60 dB/mm in diluted and concentrated films [6, 7, 61]. These values are up to 30 times more than the highest gain per unit length obtained in a dye-doped polymer amplifier [63], and up to 80 times higher than those obtained with rare earth metal amplifiers [79]. This shows that due to the low concentration quenching in conjugated polymers, much more compact amplifiers can be made. This could lead to compact fiber amplifiers highly compatible with POF and miniature amplifiers for integrated optics.

The development of all-optical switching of gain in amplifier and lasing devices demonstrates an alternative approach to nonlinear optical switching and is a promising step towards wavelength converters between the low-loss windows of silica and polymer fibers. It combines all-optical switching into a single, compact device with no complex growth or processing techniques. Moreover, the fast and full recovery of 2 ps in the conjugated polymer amplifier device is comparable with that observed in inorganic semiconducting amplifiers [92, 93, 94].

Future development of OSOAs is likely to involve combining them with POF and integrating them into optical circuits. There is considerable scope to explore their ultrafast properties further, including characterizing and controlling their effect on pulse shape. Further major challenges will be the development of continuous-wave operation of these amplifiers and, in the longer term, direct electrical pumping. In the meantime, nitride LEDs could be very attractive pump sources for indirect electrical pumping, building on their recent demonstration as pump sources for polymer lasers [27].
