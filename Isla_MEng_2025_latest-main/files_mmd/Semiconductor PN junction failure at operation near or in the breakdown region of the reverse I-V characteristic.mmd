## 1 Introduction

Most of semiconductor PN junctions from available commercial devices and integrated circuits, may exhibit failure when operation near or in the breakdown region is allowed. A peripheral surface component of the junction reverse leakage current, is unavoidable in the present state of the art of semiconductor devices. Usually, this current component is not taken into consideration in practice and theory, [1-2]. Nonetheless in [3] it is stated that the peripheral current of silicon PN junctions from modern integrated circuits may be a limiting factor for their performance in some working conditions. The surface peripheral component of reverse current is the primary component in many semiconductor junctions from discrete devices [4-5]. Significant influence of the surface component of reverse leakage current is possible on the breakdown region of electrical characteristic, [6]. This component may induce loss of junction blocking capability, after operation near or in the breakdown region. To avoid risk of failure, a maximum permissible value for the applied reverse voltage of PN junctions from available commercial discrete devices and power integrated circuits is specified. Nonetheless device ability to reach or operate in the breakdown region would be beneficial for product performance.

The aim of the paper is to provide experimental results and analysis relating to the failure mechanism of the junction at operation near or in the breakdown region of electrical characteristic.

## 2 Experimental Results. Discussion

Investigation of PN junction reverse I-V characteristics from commercial devices available on the market at this time, may reveal accentuated voltage dependence of the reverse current, \(\rm I_{B}\), when the applied voltage exceeds the maximum specified value in the data sheets. Only for controlled-avalanche junctions from specialized devices, a sharp knee of the I-V characteristic reaching the avalanche breakdown region, is visible when it is displayed by means of an I-V curve tracer. In Fig.1, typical reverse I-V characteristics are shown for a 40A, 1200 V controlled-avalanche rectifier diode, (A), for a 25A, 1200 V ordinary rectifier diode, (R), and for 20A, 1200V fast switching diode, (F). The device samples used for Fig.1 are supplied by the same semiconductor manufacturer, a leading one in the field. The diodes have a glass passivated plane junction (Fig.2). The glass passivation technique is extensively used at this time for medium power diodes and thyristors. The square shape junction size of the (R) diode is practically the same as for the (F) diode of about 4 mm. The square junction size of the (A) diode is about 5.5mm. The charge carrier lifetime in the junction base (the N low doped region) in the case of (F) diode is significant lower than in the case of (A) and (R) diodes. The reverse recovery time, \(\rm t_{sr}\), for the (F) diode is about 0.3 \(\rm\mu s\) whereas for the (A) and (R) diodes is higher than 15 \(\rm\mu s\). Although the junctions of (A) and (R) diodes have a comparable carrier lifetime in the N base, more than an order of magnitude difference in the level of \(\rm I_{R}\) is exhibited in Fig.1 at room and high temperature. Such behaviour is attributed to the surface component, \(\rm I_{RS}\), of the current \(\rm I_{R}\), [3-5], which dominates the bulk component, \(\rm I_{RB}\), of the junction (Fig.2). In the case of standard recovery junctions, i.e. with high carrier lifetime in the junction base, the component \(\rm I_{RS}\) is the primary one. For this reason, a good control of the level of \(\rm I_{RS}\) makes possible that higher reverse

voltage, \(\rm V_{R}\), to be applied without risk of junction failure. In the case of the (A) diode, at \(\rm V_{R}\) value higher than 1200 V, no accentuated voltage dependence like in the case of the (R) diode is visible. As a consequence, operation for short time in the avalanche region above \(\rm V_{R}\)=1800V is possible for the (A) diode at avalanche current, \(\rm I_{RA}\), as high as 10 mA at room and 150 \(\rm{}^{\circ}\)C. For the (R) diode, attempt to reach 10 mA leads to junction failure. Analysis of the failed junction, reveals excessive high current \(\rm I_{R}\) at lower \(\rm V_{R}\) value. A higher \(\rm V_{R}\) value towards 1000 V is not possible to be reached. This excessive leakage current of the failed junction, flows practically, through a small spot located at the junction periphery (Fig.2). Before failure, relative uniform distribution of the current \(\rm I_{R}\) on the junction perimeter has taken place. Only above 1200 V, the maximum permissible value of \(\rm V_{R}\) specified in the diode data sheet, there is significant non-uniformity of the \(\rm I_{R}\) current flow around the junction perimeter. This is manifested by noticeable deviation of the \(\rm I_{R}\) variation from a straight line (the dot lines in Fig.1). The non-uniform distribution of \(\rm I_{R}\) may favour the concentration of all the current in a small spot. In the case of the (A) diode, relative uniformity of \(\rm I_{R}\) around the junction perimeter makes possible, practically, a right knee of the I-V reverse characteristic, due to carrier avalanche multiplication at a breakdown voltage value, Vbr, close to the expected theoretical value. In the case of the (R) diode, a soft surface breakdown (without noticeable knee of the characteristic) is manifested because of excessive high level of \(\rm I_{RS}\).

In the case of the (F) fast switching diode in Fig.1, dominance of the \(\rm I_{RB}\) component (Fig.2), is expected at lower applied \(\rm V_{R}\) value. The \(\rm I_{R}\) level of the (F) diode is about an order of magnitude higher than the corresponding level of the similar (R) standard recovery diode. Nevertheless above 1000-1200 V, deviation from approximately a linear dependence of \(\rm I_{R}\) is visible as in the case of the (R) diode. Further investigation, [7], indicates that such behaviour may be attributed to the surface component \(\rm I_{RS}\) which above 1000 -1200 V becomes comparable and even higher than the bulk component \(\rm I_{RB}\). Attempts of operation of the (F) diode for short time at a current level of 10 mA leads to similar junction failure behaviour as described above for the similar (R) diode. The fact that excessive high current flow is found at lower \(\rm V_{R}\) value after failure, in a local spot at the junction periphery and not in the junction bulk, is an indication that the component \(\rm I_{RS}\) may be the primary one at high voltage.

Most of high voltage silicon PN junctions from commercial power devices available on the market at this time, are not able to operate in the breakdown region without risk of failure. For this reason, a maximum permissible value of \(\rm V_{R}\) is specified in the data sheets, so that, the reverse voltage applied to the junction even for short time to remain below the specified value. For lower working voltage diodes, a breakdown region may be exhibited when the reverse characteristic is displayed. An example is given in Fig.3 for a 5A and 600V commercial rectifier diode with a glass passivated square shape junction of about 3mm size. The diode is of standard recovery type. One can see that in the avalanche breakdown region, the current variation does not take place at constant applied voltage. If the breakdown current is increased beyond 10mA when the diode is at room temperature, then junction failure takes place by thermal second breakdown. After failure, the I-V characteristic at 20\(\rm{}^{\circ}\)C is significantly changed (the triangle point characteristic in Fig.3). Nevertheless for a 2A and 1000 V controlled-avalanche rectifier diode (Fig.4), when the initial junction temperature is 150 \(\rm{}^{\circ}\)C, the breakdown current was increased beyond 10 mA in the same conditions as for the diode in Fig.3, and no failure has occurred. The lower junction size of the 2A controlled-avalanche diode is about 2mm. Such behaviour can be explained taking into account the non-uniform flow of the breakdown current over the junction area in the case of Fig.3 and, practically, the

uniform flow of the avalanche breakdown current in the case of Fig.4. As one can see from Fig.3, a breakdown current flow at the junction periphery is correlated with visible dependence of this current to the V\({}_{\rm R}\) applied voltage, due to localized breakdown on the junction perimeter. The expected breakdown voltage manifested by vertical avalanche region dictated by the doping concentration of the N region, in the case of Fig.3 is of at least 1400 V at room temperature. Although uniform linear variation (the dotted line) of I\({}_{\rm R}\) is visible in Fig.3 up to 1000 - 1200 V, the maximum working reverse voltage is specified in the data sheet at 600 V. A value of 1000 V is not specified as in the case of the controlled-avalanche diode (Fig.4) because of risk of failure if the breakdown region is reached. Although for the sample used in Fig.3, the breakdown region is above 1000 V, for other commercial sample of the same type, it has been found around 1000 V, because of the normal spread of the voltage parameter resulted from the manufacturing process.

If the expected breakdown voltage or the bulk breakdown voltage is lower than 1000 V, it has been found from investigation of many device junctions that the measured breakdown voltage may be closer to the bulk breakdown value. In such a case, a weak negative level angle of the junction (Fig.2), or the quality of the silicon-dielectric interface at the junction periphery resulted from the passivation process, do not cause a large difference between the obtained breakdown voltage and the expected one. The existing commercial Zener diodes and transient voltage suppressor (TVS) diodes, are able to withstand high values of the avalanche breakdown current because the difference between the measured breakdown voltage value and the expected bulk breakdown is low. Nevertheless the breakdown voltage value of a PN junction from available commercial Zener or TVS diodes is not higher than 400 -500 V. An example is given in Fig.5 for a bi-directional transient voltage suppressor (P\({}^{\rm{+}}\)NP\({}^{\rm{+}}\) silicon die). It is a commercialised device in small quantity with a diameter of the silicon die of about 15 mm. The breakdown voltage value at low current (10 \(\mu\)A) is about 400 V and corresponds to a breakdown start at the junction periphery. At a current level of 1A most of the avalanche current, I\({}_{\rm{RA}}\),is already distributed over the junction area. The difference between the junction surface breakdown voltage (at low avalanche current) and the bulk breakdown voltage (at high avalanche current) is less than 50V. From Fig.5 one can see that for a standard exponential waveform with a 1ms duration of the avalanche current, a peak value as high as 30A can be applied without significant increase of the voltage drop on the device. The curvature of the I-V characteristic is due to the fact that during the applied avalanche pulse current, the instantaneous junction temperature may reach a value as high as 200 \({}^{\circ}\)C. If the duration of the applied pulse is significant shorter, for example 20 \(\mu\)s, then no curvature of the avalanche I-V characteristic is observed. The dotted line characteristic in Fig.5 (at 1A, 50V/div), near the No.2 characteristic is for a 20 \(\mu\)s exponential pulse. For 1ms pulse duration, applied peak avalanche current higher than 30A leads to device catastrophic failure. An electrical short-circuit of the device tested PN junction is manifested due to a spot of material damage at the junction periphery. The damaged region of approximately round shape, includes a portion of silicon material and one portion of dielectric passivation material. The diameter of the spot has been found of about 0.5 mm. It has been observed that the failure takes place to the end of the applied exponential pulse, i.e. when the junction instantaneous temperature is high. This behaviour is due to the surface peripheral component I\({}_{\rm{RAS}}\) of the avalanche current, I\({}_{\rm{RA}}\). The component I\({}_{\rm{RAS}}\) at high I\({}_{\rm{RA}}\) level, is significant lower than the bulk component, I\({}_{\rm{RAB}}\), uniformly distributed over the junction area. Nonetheless, at lower I\({}_{\rm{RA}}\) level, the two components I\({}_{\rm{RAS}}\) and I\({}_{\rm{RAB}}\) become comparable and overheating at the junction periphery is possible, [7], because the power dissipation corresponding to I\({}_{\rm{RAS}}\) is concentrated in a much smaller volume than I\({}_{\rm{RAB}}\). The component I\({}_{\rm{RAS}}\) of the avalanche current may be even more non-uniformly distributed on the junction perimeter than the component I\({}_{\rm{RS}}\) of the saturation current. For similar devices as the sample used in Fig.5, catastrophic failure takes place at lower applied I\({}_{\rm{RA}}\) current peak if the avalanche breakdown voltage difference, \(\Delta\)V\({}_{\rm{RA}}\),at low and high I\({}_{\rm{RA}}\) current level is higher than 50V, [8].

As it is known, in the case of power MOSFET integrated devices there are special protective PN junctions, paralleled to the cellular drain junction, able to work for short time in the breakdown region. In this case, planar oxide passivation junctions are realized with suitable junction termination. A visible breakdown region is exhibited in Fig.6 for the case of a power MOS transistor. Nevertheless a sharp knee of the breakdown current as in the Fig. 1 or Fig.4 case is not

**Fig. 4: Typical reverse I-V characteristics at room and high junction temperature for a commercial controlled-avalanche rectifier diode of 2A and 1000V**observed, because at lower level of the breakdown current the surface component has significant contribution. Operation in the breakdown region beyond the specifications, resulted in device catastrophic failure with a small region of degraded material, located at the junction periphery.

Electrical characteristics shown in Fig.7 for an IGBT in the off state, indicate a breakdown region where at higher current level, noticeable voltage dependence is exhibited due to the junction surface breakdown. The un-reached bulk breakdown region is expected at higher value of the collector -emitter voltage. Similar behaviour (Fig.8) is possible for a mesa silicon diode with positive level angle (not negative like in Fig.2) if insufficiencies in the junction passivation process are not eliminated. The expected bulk breakdown voltage value for the diode in Fig.5 is about 900V. For the junction passivation, silicone rubber has been as dielectric material. This organic material is still used for the passivation of high power diodes and thyristors. Although the area of the diode sample used for Fig.8 is ten times higher than that of the diode used for Fig.4, failure takes place at lower power than in Fig.4 case, when operation in the breakdown region takes place. To reach the expected value of the avalanche bulk breakdown voltage, the quality of the silicon-dielectric interface from the junction periphery is of great importance. A suitable space charge layer at the junction peripheral surface ensures that the bulk breakdown is reached and premature surface breakdown is avoided [8]. Nevertheless in the junction passivation process, this surface space charge layer is not easy to be realized.

## 3 Conclusions

Typical I-V reverse characteristics reaching the breakdown region at room and high temperature are presented for silicon PN junctions from available commercial silicon bipolar and MOS devices. In the case of high voltage bipolar devices, only for controlled-avalanche junctions, operation in the breakdown region in specified conditions, may take place

without risk of failure. In such a case the current flow in the breakdown region is distributed not only at the junction periphery but also in the junction bulk. For ordinary junctions, a maximum permissible value of the applied reverse voltage is specified so that the breakdown region is not reached. Attempt of operation in the breakdown region in such a case leads to junction failure. The reverse current component flowing at the junction periphery, induces local junction overheating followed by device failure. Analysis of a failed junction after operation in the breakdown region, reveals excessive high reverse leakage current in comparison with the state before failure. Even an electrical short-circuit is possible. The defect, usually with a size not higher than 0.5mm is caused by a small region of material damage at the junction periphery.
