## Introduction

GaN-based high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) can be widely used in RF/microwave power applications. For improving the gate aspect radio, gate recessing process was often adopted. Cl\({}_{2}\)-based plasma was widely used for the dry etching of (Al)GaN materials.[1] However, inevitable damage and surface states will be introduced after the Cl\({}_{2}\)-based plasma etching process.[2] In addition, effective surface barrier height was also deteriorated. As known to us, gate recessing process was usually carried out after the removal of (Si\({}_{3}\)N\({}_{4}\)) passivation layer under the gate region, and CF\({}_{4}\)-based plasma was often used to removing Si\({}_{3}\)N\({}_{4}\) layer. Thus, when using Cl\({}_{2}\)-based plasma for gate recessing process, two gas atmospheres including CF\({}_{4}\)-Cl\({}_{2}\)-based plasma should be alternately changed, causing complicated process and the sample may be contaminated during the waiting interval or being exposed to the air.

The etching effect of CF\({}_{4}\) plasma on (Al)GaN has been discussed[3], when using CF\({}_{4}\) plasma for gate recessing process, the above mentioned Cl\({}_{2}\)-based gate recessing issues would be relieved. In our previous work,[4] CF\({}_{4}\) plasma gate recessing process was utilized to fabricate high performance normally-off HEMTs for millimeter-wave application.

In this work, by tailoring the gas flow rate, self-DC bias, RF power and coil power of inductively coupled plasma (ICP), the CF\({}_{4}\)-plasma was intentionally used for gate recessing process. Two kinds of recessed-gate devices recessed for the same etching depth by CF\({}_{4}\) plasma (CF\({}_{4}\)-RGD) and Cl\({}_{2}\) plasma (Cl\({}_{2}\)-RGD) were fabricated, respectively. CF\({}_{4}\)-RGD showed an increase in both DC and RF performance, indicating that CF\({}_{4}\) plasma is a promising candidate for the gate recessing process in GaN-based HEMTs, especially suitable for the fabrication of microwave applications.

## Device structure and fabrication

The AlGaN/GaN heterostructure used in this work was grown on a 3-inch SiC substrate by MOCVD. The epilayer consists of a 2-\(\upmu\)m un-doped GaN buffer layer, a 1-nm AlN interlayer, a 26-nm Al\({}_{0.25}\)Ga\({}_{0.75}\)N barrier layer and a 1-nm GaN cap layer as shown in Fig 1(a) and Fig 1(b). Hall measurements show the electron mobility and sheet carrier density of the heterostructure are 1875 cm\({}^{2}\) V\({}^{1}\) s\({}^{-1}\) and 8.6\(\times\) 10\({}^{12}\) cm\({}^{2}\), respectively.

The devices fabrication process started with the formation of source/drain ohmic contact using Ti/Al/Ni/Au metallization annealed at 840 \({}^{\circ}\)C for 30s in N\({}_{2}\) ambient. Prior to mesa isolation, the devices surface were first passivated with 120-nm Si\({}_{3}\)N\({}_{4}\) by PECVD. Then the devices were prepared for gate windows open and gate recessing process by ICP. Two kinds of recessed gate structures named sample A and B were fabricated. Sample A was recessed using CF\({}_{4}\) plasma immediately after the removal of Si\({}_{3}\)N\({}_{4}\) layer under the gate region without changing the gas atmosphere. While sample B was recessed by Cl\({}_{2}\) plasma with changing the gas atmosphere from CF\({}_{4}\) plasma (for the removal of Si\({}_{3}\)N\({}_{4}\)) to Cl\({}_{2}\) plasma. Control samples without Si\({}_{3}\)N\({}_{4}\) were accomplished with sample A and B during the two different etching processes for the purpose of monitoring the recessed depth. By adjusting the parameters of ICP power, self-DC bias and CF\({}_{4}\) plasma flow rate, the removal of Si\({}_{3}\)N\({}_{4}\) and gate recessing process with CF

plasma were carried out respectively [4]. For comparison, the etching depth of sample A and B are made consisted with each other. As shown in Fig. 1(e) and Fig. 1(f), the etching depths for both kinds of structures are \(\sim\)15 nm. Then the gate metal with Ni/Au/Ni was evaporated by E-beam. To improve the gate stability and firming the fluorine ions, post gate annealing was carried out in N\({}_{2}\) atmosphere at 400 \({}^{\circ}\)C for 2min. The sample without gate recessing was also fabricated for reference. The gate length, gate-to-source and gate-to-drain distance for all the devices are 0.25, 1.25 and 2.5\(\mu\)m, respectively.

### Device characteristics and discussion

Fig. 2 shows the DC characteristics comparison of the two kinds of recessed gate AlGaN/GaN HEMTs. In this work, the threshold voltage (V\({}_{\text{th}}\)) was defined at the gate voltage when drain current was 1 mA/mm. From the transfer curves measured at V\({}_{\text{th}}\)=6V [as shown in Fig 2(a) and Fig 2(b)], the V\({}_{\text{th}}\) for CF\({}_{4}\)-RGD, Cl\({}_{2}\)-RGD and reference device are -0.75, -1.35 and -4.55 V, respectively. While the peak transconductance G\({}_{\text{m}}\) are 370, 339 and 282 mS/mm. The subthreshold slopes (SS) are 85, 100 and 150mV/dec. In addition, the maximum drain current at Vg=3 V are 1041 and 1140 mA/mm as shown in Fig. 2 (c) and Fig. 2 (d). The above results indicated that CF\({}_{\text{x}}\)-RGD showed more impressive DC performance than Cl\({}_{2}\)-RGD.

The more positive V\({}_{\text{th}}\) and the lower off-state drain leakage current of the CF\({}_{\text{x}}\)-RGD were attributed to the injected fluorine ions during the CF\({}_{\text{x}}\)-plasma gate recessing process, which will enhance the effective barrier height 0\(\hbar\)/\(\Phi\)+0\(b\) and deplete the 2DEG density \(q\)ns as shown in Fig.3.(a) and (b). Thus, resulting in better gate control, improved SS, and a high I\({}_{\text{ON}}\)/I\({}_{\text{OFF}}\) ratio large than 10\({}^{\circ}\). The increased G\({}_{\text{m}}\) value was due to the higher effective channel mobility under the gate which can be obtained from the output curves [4]. What's more, from the AFM image of the two structures as shown in Fig 1(e) and Fig 1(f), the surface roughness of CF\({}_{\text{x}}\)-RGD was smaller.

To further investigate the stability of the two kinds of RGDs, the transfer curves under different drain voltage biases and sweeping directions were measured.

Fig. 4 show the transfer curves of Cl\({}_{2}\)-RGD and CF\({}_{\text{x}}\)-RGD when V\({}_{\text{ds}}\) decreased from 10 to 6 V in both forward sweep (Vg from -4 to 3 V, solid line) and back sweep (Vg from 3 to -4 V, dash line). The peak G\({}_{\text{m}}\) of Cl\({}_{2}\)-RGD were 352, 351, and 339 mS/mm for V\({}_{\text{ds}}\) changing from 10 to 6 V in forward sweep and 315, 314, 300 mS/mm in back sweep. While the peak G\(\Gamma\) of Cr\({}_{\text{x}}\)-RGD were 383, 380, and 370 mS/mm for V\({}_{\text{ds}}\) changing from 10 to 6 V in forward sweep and 370, 367, 362 mS/mm in back sweep.

Obviously, Cl\({}_{2}\)-RGD showed larger peak G\({}_{\text{m}}\) degradation under different sweeping directions (G\({}_{\text{m}}\) dropt about 11.5% from forward to back sweep) and different drain voltage biases (G\({}_{\text{m}}\) dropt about 3.7% from V\({}_{\text{ds}}\)=10 V to V\({}_{\text{ds}}\)=6 V). On the contrary, the degradation of peak G\(\Gamma\) for CF\({}_{\text{x}}\)-RGD under sweeping direction and drain voltage bias were only 2.2% and 3.4%. The reason for this maybe the different etching conditions under the gate region. Since Cl\({}_{2}\)-based plasma etching would induce defects and nitrogen-vacancy (V\({}_{\text{N}}\)) in AlGaN surface, causing V\({}_{\text{N}}\) related donor-like surface states [5], as a result, bring the G\({}_{\text{m}}\) deterioration. However the nitrogen-vacancy would be filled by fluorine ions during CF

-based plasma etching process [6], thus resulting in a relatively stable DC characteristics.

Finally, the RF performance of Cl\({}_{2}\)-RGD and CF\({}_{4}\)-RGD were characterized from 0.1 to 40 GHz using an Agilent 8363B network analyzer calibrated with a short-open-through calibration standard. The measured data were de-embedded by utilizing cold and hot FET technique.

Fig. 5(a) and Fig. 5(b) shows the current gain \(|h_{21}|^{2}\), Mason's unilateral gain \(U\), and maximum available gain (MAG) varies with frequency of Cl\({}_{2}\)-RGD at V\({}_{\rm GS}\)=0.2 V and V\({}_{\rm DS}\)=10V and CF\({}_{x}\)-RGD at V\({}_{\rm GS}\)=0.4 V and V\({}_{\rm DS}\)=10V. By extrapolating measured data with a slope of -20 dB/decade, the current gain cutoff frequency \(f_{\rm T}\) for Cl\({}_{2}\)-RGD and CF\({}_{4}\)-RGD are estimated to be 45 and 49 GHz. Meanwhile, the \(f_{\rm max}\) extrapolated from \(U\) was 118 and 153 GHz. It was noted that the\(f_{\rm max}\) extrapolated from \(U\) and MAG are consisted with each other.

The improved RF performance of CF\({}_{4}\)-RGD was mainly due to its higher transconductance and reduced N-vacancy which was filled by fluorine ions. As a result, the gate control and speed of CF\({}_{4}\)-RGD was improved.

## Conclusions

Two kinds of recessed gate AlGaN/GaN HEMTs were implemented using Cl\({}_{2}\)-based (Cl\({}_{2}\)-RGD) and CF\({}_{4}\)-based (CF\({}_{4}\)-RGD) plasma gate recess process. The CF\({}_{4}\)-RGD showed more outstanding DC (including higher and stable peak Gm) and RF (including higher f\({}_{\rm T}\) and f\({}_{\rm max}\)) performance than Cl\({}_{2}\)-RGD. This indicates that CF\({}_{4}\) plasma is a promising candidate for the gate recessing process in GaN-based HEMTs, especially suitable for the fabrication of microwave applications.
