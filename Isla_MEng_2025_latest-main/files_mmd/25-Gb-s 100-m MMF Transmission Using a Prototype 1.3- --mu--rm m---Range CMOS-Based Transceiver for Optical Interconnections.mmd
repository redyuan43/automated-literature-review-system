100-m GI50 MMF. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration using the 1.3-\(\mu\)m-range CMOS-based transceiver for 25-Gb/s error-free transmission over 100-m MMF.

Dispersion power penalties due to intersymbol interference were calculated as a function of MMF transmission distance for various MMFs with different modal bandwidths and for various wavelengths. The theory used for the calculation is based on Gaussian impulse response [9]. It is known to be valid for the OFL condition [10]. The parameters used in this calculation were pulse width of 40 psec, modal bandwidths of MMFs of 1444 MHz\(\cdot\)km, 4500 MHz\(\cdot\)km, 10,000 MHz\(\cdot\)km, chromatic dispersions of 120 ps/nm/km for 0.85 \(\mu\)m, 35 ps/nm/km for 1.07 \(\mu\)m, and 6 ps/nm/km for 1.3 \(\mu\)m [10], and modulation laser linewidth of 0.5 nm. The dispersion power penalty for 100-m 1444 MHz-km MMF was 1.6 dB, which agrees well with the experimental result (i.e., 1.44 dB) shown in Fig. 6. It is evident that the wavelength of 1.3-\(\mu\)m is suitable for longer-distance MMF transmission due to extremely low chromatic dispersion at that wavelength. This result shows the possibility of over-500-m MMF transmission if 10,000-MHz\(\cdot\)km-modal-bandwidth class of MMF were realized. The power dissipation is only 9 mW/Gb/s (6.3 mW/Gb/s for the transmitter and 2.7 mW/Gb/s for the receiver).

## IV Conclusion

A prototype transceiver for optical interconnections, composed of a 1.3-\(\mu\)m-range lens-integrated LD (LISEL) and PD (LIPD) as well as a CMOS LDD and TIA, was fabricated. It demonstrated 25-Gb/s error-free transmission over 100-m GI50 MMF with power dissipation of only 9 mW/Gb/s. The lens-integrated LD and PD provide highly efficient and easy optical coupling to the fibers. These results indicate that the fabricated transceiver can be applied for board-to-board as well as rack-to-rack optical interconnections.
