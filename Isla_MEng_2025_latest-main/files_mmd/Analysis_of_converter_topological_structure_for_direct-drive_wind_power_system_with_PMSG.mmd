### _Back to back double PWM converter topology_

Figure 2 is a back to back double PWM converter topology diagram, stator of generator connects to the power grid through the back to back double PWM converter. PWM converter of generator side controls generator electromagnetic torque and the stator's reactive power (usually the value is zero), by adjusting the d-axis and q-axis current of the stator side. Therefore, the generator operates in variable speed constant frequency condition, achieves the function of maximum wind energy capture under rated wind speed. By adjusting the d-axis and q-axis current of grid side, grid side PWM converter can maintain DC voltage stably, achieve decoupled control of active and reactive power. Control the reactive power which flows to the grid, and operates in the unity power factor condition. Furthermore, grid side converter must ensure the converter's output THD as small as possible, that will improve the power quality of the grid.

Back to back Double PWM converter structure is the most typical form of topology in direct-driven wind power system. Researches in this field are concentrated in converter modeling, control algorithm and the control strategy of how to improve fault through abilities and so on[9][10]. With the strong commonality of this topology, both generator side and grid side converter have the same main circuits, and similar control circuits and control algorithm. They are based on the digital control of DSP, with the flexibility of vector control, and achieve four-quadrant operation function, that enables excellent control of motor speed governing and power delivery to the grid. In addition, higher efficiency of dual-PWM converter, for it is a two-level transformation device.

It also has some disadvantages, e.g. a great number of full-control mode components are required, adoption of complex control circuit while vector control of generator side converter often need to measure motor speed and other information, that makes a relatively higher costs.

## III Converter topological structure for Practical High-Power direct-driven wind power system

Typical principle diagram of high-power direct-driven wind power system is shown in Fig.3. Uncontrolled rectifier is used in the front end of system. In DC to DC part, there are three paralleled chopper circuits which work in Current Continuous Mode. Three-phase combinatorial converter is adopted in the inverter part. This system structure is adopted universally in high-power direct-driven wind power system, and has advantages of steady operation, easy control method, grid side power factor is 98%, lower harmonic interaction with the grid.

IV Converter topological structures for high-voltage and multilevel high-power direct-driven wind power system

As a new type of high-voltage and high-power converter, multilevel converter smooth away some disadvantages of traditional converter and get higher quality output waveform. Dynamic voltage-sharing circuits and output transformer are not required. it also possess the advantages of lower switch frequency, smaller stress of switch units, higher system efficiency.

With the rising capacity of switch unit and improvement of switch on/off characteristic, advantages of multilevel converter are more and more dramatically. Less input and output harmonic, smaller size and capacity of input filter, reduction of electromagnetic interference. Compared with traditional two-level converter, multilevel converter has less switching loss, for its switch frequency decreased by 25%. It is also has disadvantages, about the balance of DC voltage. Hardware solution needs extra switching tube, this will increase system cost and reduce system stability. Software solution will take control of modulation signal, and increase the burden of calculation. There are already some solutions to solve this problem[11][1][5].

The market trend of wind power generator is the increase of rated capacity, higher level of electric voltage and current. It made multilevel converter will be applied to new-type generator. With the rapid increase of voltage level, multilevel converter will connect to the micro grid directly, leaving out heavy booster transformer.

Many topological structures come out after the idea of multilevel converter put forward, they can be summarized in the following three kinds: Diode-clamped multi-level converter, Cascaded H-bridge multilevel converter and Flying-capacitor multilevel converter.

### _Topology of Diode-clamped multi-level converter_

Application of Diode-clamped multi-level converter connect with direct-drive system is shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5, both the front-end and back-end of system can use this topology.

Diode-clamped converter have both advantages of multiplex and pulse width modulation: high output power, lower device switching frequency, higher equivalent switching frequency. Do not need transformer connects to AC side, good dynamic response, wider communication bandwidth and so on.

However, this converter also has shortcomings, mainly in three aspects.

1) Camped-diode need to tolerate higher voltage, and need large quantity. For an m-level converter, if each diode has the same voltage tolerate level, required diodes number of each phase is (m-1) \(\times\) (m-2). That is not only a significant increase to the cost, but also causing considerable difficulties when installed on the line. Generally, study in this field is limited to seven or nine-level converter in practical application.

2) The switching-on load device is inconsistent. Imbalance of switching-on load will lead to different current of switching devices. In the circuits, if we consider the most serious case of load when design components' current level, that will cause higher current level of 2 \(\times\) (m-2) outer device in each phase, and this is a serious waste of resources.

3) When the converter is transmitting active power, charge and discharge time of capacitor in DC side can be different. This will result in voltage imbalance of capacitor, and more difficulties of the system dynamic control.

### _Topology of Cascaded H-bridge Multilevel Converter_

Application of Cascaded H-bridge Multilevel Converter connect with direct-driven system is shown in Figure 6[17]-[20]. This system use Multi-phase Permanent Magnetic Syndenous Generator to provide independent power supply for each H-bridge, combined high-power direct-drive system with the Cascade H-bridge converter perfectly.

Cascaded H-bridge Multilevel Converter has many advantages as follows:

1) Use less power electronic components when we get the same number of output level.

2) Each converter unit has the same structure, it provides convenience for modular design and packaging technique.

3) For the relative independent of each converter unit, it will be easier to use the soft switching control method.

4) Voltage-sharing of DC side is easy.

5) Same operating loads value of each converter unit.

6) Power unit by-pass circuit can be used for the circuits design, that make control system cuts fault unit online and ensure the system continues to work.

This topology also has certain disadvantages:

1) Occasion of the active power transformation need independent DC sources, which makes application restrictions in some areas.

2) Each basic unit of H-bridge converter need a DC power source to achieve clamping function, with the increasing number of output waveform level, the number of DC power supply used by string-level unit will also increase.

### _Topology of Flying-capacator multilevel converter_

Application of Flying-capacitor converter connect with direct-drive system is shown in Figure 7 and Figure 8. The system topology is similar to Diode-clamped multi-level converter, both the front-end and back-end of system use flying-capacitor converters.

Fig. 4: Topology of diode rectifier + Boost chopper circuit + Diode-clamped inverter of high-power direct-driven wind power system

Fig. 5: Topology of back to back diode-clamped converter of high-power direct-driven wind power system

Fig. 6: Topology of cascaded H-bridge direct-driven wind power system

Fig. 7: Topology of diode rectifier + Boost chopper circuit + Flying-capacitor inverter of high-power direct-driven wind power systemThe freedom degree and flexibility of power level synthesis of Flying-capacitor multilevel converter is higher than the Diode-clamped multi-level converter[10, 21]. Advantages of this system are detailed as follows:

1) Flexible switching methods.

2) Stronger protection ability of the power devices.

3) Both active power and reactive power can be controlled.

4) This system is suitable for High Voltage DC Transmission Systems.

Disadvantages are embodied mainly in three aspects:

1) Large amounts of storage capacitors are required. If the voltage level of all of the capacitors is equal to major power devices, to an m-level flying capacitor multi-level converters, bridge arm of each phase need auxiliary capacitances by the number of (m-1) \(\times\) (m-2) /2, and the DC side needs (m-1) capacitors. If the level is higher to a certain degree, this converter will not only difficult to install, but also very expensive.

2) When the capacitor is charging or discharging, in order to keep balance, different switch combinations will be used to get the median level. This will increase the complexity of system control, cause high switching frequency and large switching losses of the devices.

3) Similar to Diode-clamped multi-level converter, Flying-capacitor multilevel converter also has the problem that the switching-on load is inconsistent.

Former study of wind power generation system, mostly by uncontrolled rectifier or two-level PWM rectifier, resulting in poor current waveform of AC voltage, the power factor value can't meet requirement, and it will be harmful to generator's AC side and stability of normal operation. Application of three-level PWM rectifier which adopt SVPWM control strategy, that will reach the objectives of power factor adjustable in AC side, reduce waveform distortion rate, and achieve high-power transmission[22, 23].

## V Conclusions

Direct-driven wind power system needs full power converter. Before the breakthrough of current voltage toleration level, multi-level technology is quite applicable in direct-driven wind power system, because it can reduce the voltage stress of switch and the equivalent switching frequency. This paper analysis several typical converter topologies and high-voltage, high-power converter topologies in detail which suitable for direct-drive wind power system, it points out that Uncontrolled rectifier + DC to DC convert + inverter topology can only be used in small power lever or MW-lever direct-drive wind power system. Back to back double PWM converter topology need a great number of full-control mode components and adopt complex control circuit. Flying-capacitor multilevel converter's switching-on load is inconsistent. Voltage imbalance of flying-capacitors is difficult to achieve. To H-bridge multi-level converter, it needs an independent power supply, and higher cost. Although the diode-clamped multi-level converter has the problem, such as the voltage balance of neutral point, that can be solved through appropriate control strategies[25, 27]. Therefore, for the advantages of low-cost and simple control strategy, diode-clamped three-level PWM converter now is the hot spot of current converting technique study for direct-driven wind power system.
