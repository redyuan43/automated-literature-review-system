Current high-efficiency tandem-junction solar cells for use in space power systems incorporate 3 homojunctions of In\({}_{\alpha}\)Ga\({}_{\alpha}\)P, GaAs, and Ge with respective bandgap energies of 1.85, 1.42, and 0.67 eV, monolithitally grown on Ge substrates using primarily metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). An air mass 0 (AM0) conversion efficiency of \(\sim\)25.7% from these conventional 3-junction InGaP/GaAs/Ge solar cell design has been demonstrated.[1] However, there is a major loss mechanism inherent to this design. The large energy difference (\(\sim\)0.75 eV) between the bandgaps of Ge and GaAs results in a significant amount of super-bandgap energy loss (to Ge) in the form of heat. This loss can be minimized through the use of a fourth junction in a material having a bandgap between those of Ge and GaAs. In this paper we propose, and present the first results on, the use of InGaAsN, a material with a bandgap of \(\sim\)1 eV and lattice-matched to both GaAs and Ge, as a promising such material.

We have performed simulations which indicate that an optimal 4-junction design would have an InGaAsN junction with bandgap energy at 1.05 eV and a top InGaAP junction at 2.0 eV. Assuming infinite optical thickness and ideal characteristics for all the junctions and tunnel junctions, the AM0 efficiency could theoretically be as high as 42.3%. Also, when the compositions of In\({}_{\alpha}\)Ga\({}_{\alpha}\)As\({}_{\gamma}\)N\({}_{\gamma}\) are properly selected (x-3y), this material can be lattice-matched to GaAs or Ge substrates. Even with this lattice-matching constraint, this quaternary provides a bandgap energy ranging from 0 to 1.42 eV.

We have developed an MOCVD process for the growth of uniform and reproducible lattice-matched InGaAsN as suggested by elastic recoil detection and x-ray rocking curves. The growth conditions are entirely compatible with the conditions for the growth of traditional 3-junction solar cells. Intense and sharp optical absorption was achieved at 1.05 eV. Both p- and n-type doping in InGaAsN have been obtained in the range of 1x10\({}^{16}\) to 5x10\({}^{18}\) cm\({}^{3}\). InGaAsN pn junctions were fabricated with 300-nm thick 3x10\({}^{18}\)cm\({}^{3}\) p-type layer doped with C and 800-nm thick 6x10\({}^{16}\)cm\({}^{3}\) n-type layer doped with Si. Excellent diode characteristics with a forward leakage current density of 6x10\({}^{14}\) A/cm\({}^{2}\) and an ideality factor of 1.8 (without a surface passivation layer) were achieved. The InGaAsN pn junction was examined for its photovoltaic properties using an X25 solar simulator. The preliminary result on a 1x1 cm\({}^{2}\) cell shows good photovoltaic behaviors with an open-circuit voltage of \(\sim\)0.47 V and short-circuit current of 13 mA/cm\({}^{2}\). Results on optimized single LaGa\(\times\)AnN junction and integrated 4-junction InGaAP/GaAs/InGaAsN/Ge solar cells having the bandgap energy combination of 2.0/1.42/1.05/0.67eV will also be discussed.

In summary, we have developed a novel low-bandgap (1.05 eV) pn junction, based on InGaAsN, which is promising for next-generation high-efficiency solar cells. This work is supported by the US DOE under contact No. DE-AC04-94AL8500 and by the US Air Force Research Laboratory.
