###### Abstract

The nanoscale properties of CsPbI3 quantum dots allows for the advantageous manipulation of its phase diagram. We show that these all-inorganic halide perovskite nanocrystals can be used to fabricate colloidal perovskite quantum dot solar cells with low voltage losses. Despite only recently emerging on the photovoltaic scene, CsPbI3 quantum dot solar cells have already achieved approximately 85% of their Shockley-Quessier limit open-circuit voltage, among the lowest voltage loss achieved for any material with a band gap of 1.7 eV, excepting III-V semiconductors. The low losses in these devices recently led to a world record certified quantum dot solar cell efficiency of 13.4%. While single junction thin film perovskite solar cells have surpassed 22% power conversion efficiency, perovskite-perovskite tandem solar cells offer the potential for power conversion efficiencies exceeding 30%. However, to accomplish this ambitious goal, perovskite solar cells must be designed with low losses and the appropriate band gaps, which differ from the ideal band gap for single junction perovskite solar cells. In this respect, the incredibly low voltage loss and tunable band gap of CsPbI3 quantum dots make them ideally suited for all-perovskite tandem solar cell applications.

## I Introduction

Halide perovskites offer the potential to revolutionize the photovoltaic (PV) landscape with their unique combination of efficiency and manufacturability.[1, 2, 3] While most of the research community's focus has thus far been on the development of halide perovskite polycrystalline thin films, the recent advent of CsPbI3 quantum dots (QD) opened a new area of materials research,[4] particularly following the demonstration of their nanoscale phase stability and application in optoelectronic devices.[5]

While the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction perovskite photovoltaics has reached 22.7%,[6] the development of perovskite-perovskite tandem solar cells represents a feasible path toward a 30% efficient solution-processed PV module.[7] While the highest efficiency single-junction perovskite solar cells have band gaps of 1.5-1.6 eV,[8] band gaps of 1.22 eV, the lowest band gap thus far achieved with standard halide perovskites, and 1.7-1.9 eV are required for high efficiency tandem solar cells.[7, 9] Therefore, the design of low-loss perovskite solar cells in these band gap regions is critical for the realization of high efficiency tandem solar cells.

While all-inorganic halide perovskites, such as CsPbI3 and CsPbI3,3Brx remove the compositional instabilities associated with volatile organic cations such as methylammonium (MA),[10, 11], the phase transitions in these all-inorganic materials are more problematic than those in MAPbI3. The relevant phase transitions in all inorganic perovskites are no longer simply rotations of the corner-sharing [PbI6]4-octahedra[12], but a change from 3-dimensional networks of corner-sharing [PbI6]4-octahedra to 1-dimensional chains of edge-sharing octahedra (a non-perovskite phase) which coincides with large changes in optical absorption.[13]

CsPbI3 QD solar cells (QDSC) show tremendous promise as wide band gap cells because their small size or surface properties alter the phase diagram of the material, stabilizing the desired crystalline phase of the material (corner-sharing [PbI6]4- octahedra).[5, 14] Additionally, they have open circuit voltages (\(V_{OC}\)) exceeding 1.2 V for 1.7 eV band gap, among the highest \(V_{OC}\) of any non-III-V material. Figure 1 demonstrates the low voltage deficit by comparing the \(V_{OC}\) of

record devices of common PV technologies[15] to their theoretical _VOC_ under 1-Sun conditions, as calculated by the Shockley-Quessier limit.[16]

Moreover, as has been demonstrated in other QDSCs, most notably in PbS,[17] the band gap of the CsPbI\({}_{3}\) QD absorber can be readily tuned simply by tuning the QD size, and this band gap shift is retained in electronically coupled arrays.[5] Importantly, the size tunability of the band gap of CsPbI\({}_{3}\) means that these solar cell materials can achieve band gap tunability in the range desired for tandem applications without the need for alloying iodide and bromide materials (_e.g._, CsPbI\({}_{3.8}\)Br\({}_{3}\)) which can result in deleterious halide segregation.[18, 19, 20]

By improving the QD coupling of CsPbI\({}_{3}\) QD films, we have been able to achieve a world record certified quantum dot solar cell efficiency of 13.4%.[14] CsPbI\({}_{3}\) QDs have now been implemented into high-efficiency, transparent device stacks which exhibit high transmission at photon energies \(<\)1.75 eV. These semi-transparent CsPbI\({}_{3}\) QDSCs are well-suited for applications as a top-cell for all-perovskite tandem solar cells.

## II Experimental

Synthesis of CsPbI\({}_{3}\) QDs can be carried out following previously reported methods.[5, 21] Following synthesis, washing of the QDs was performed using methyl acetate (MeOAc), as previously reported.[5] This washing step removes excess precursor materials and is critical to maintaining phase-stable CsPbI\({}_{3}\).[5] The long-chain ligands covering the surface of the QDs following synthesis allow these materials to be easily suspended in non-polar solvents; however, the ligands are electronically insulating. Electronically coupled CsPbI\({}_{3}\) films were fabricated as previously reported.[14] All fabrication steps were carried out under ambient conditions with approximately 10-20% relative humidity. Briefly, the films were deposited in a layer-by-layer approach in which (i) a concentrated solution of the washed CsPbI\({}_{3}\) QDs was cast onto a substrate by spin-coating from octane, (ii) the film was briefly (2-4 s) dipped in a saturated solution of Pb(NO\({}_{3}\))\({}_{2}\) in MeOAc, and then (iii) dipped in a neat MeOAc solution. These steps can be repeated multiple times to tune the QD film thickness (typically 3-4 layers). Lastly, (iv) the QD film was immersed in a saturated solution of formamidinium iodide (FAI) in ethyl acetate for 10 s to improve QD coupling and film mobility.[14]

CsPbI\({}_{3}\) solar cells were fabricated by first depositing a compact TiO\({}_{2}\) layer, as described previously,[14] on a cleaned FTO substrate and then depositing the CsPbI\({}_{3}\) QD film onto the TiO\({}_{2}\) as described above. Spiro-OMeTAD (2,2',7,7' -tetrakis(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9.9 ',' -spirobiltoorene) was then deposited by spin-coating from a chlorobenzene solution with added lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and 4-_tert_-butylpyridine (tBP).[14] Following spiro-OMeTAD deposition the devices were allowed to remain in air overnight before depositing the top electrode. Conventional opaque devices and transparent top-contact devices were fabricated similarly. In both cases, 15 nm of MoO\({}_{x}\) was evaporated. The opaque top electrode was Al,[22] deposited by thermal evaporation, while the transparent top electrode was a sputtered zinc oxide-based transparent conducting oxide (TCO).

## III Results and Discussion

The device architectures and representative current density-voltage (_J-V_) scans for standard opaque and transparent devices are shown in Figure 2. From a reverse _J-V_ scan, the opaque device had a short-circuit current (_JSC_) of 15.88 mA/cm\({}^{2}\), a _VOC_ of 1.170 V, a fill factor (FF) of 0.770, and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.30 %. Similarly, the transparent device had a _JSC_ of 13.66 mA/cm\({}_{2}\), a _VOC_ of 1.190 V, a FF of 0.732, and a PCE of 11.90 %.

The performance of these solar cells, which have a band gap of 1.71 eV, as calculated from the absorption onset by Tauc analysis, are promising for tandem solar cell applications; however, long wavelength transparency is critical for the eventual coupling of these devices with an efficient low band gap bottom cell. Transmission (Figure 3) was measured of the transparent CsPbI\({}_{3}\) solar cell device stack to elucidate parasitic optical losses. The transmission spectrum of the complete device stack shows good transmission at energies less than 1.7 eV with a maximum value of over 70% and an average value of 66 % between 1.7 and 1.25 eV. It is anticipated that the optical transmittance of these devices can be further improved by the implementation of new hole transport materials with lower optical absorbance than spiro-OMeTAD, for example the recently reported hole transport material EH44.[23]

## IV Summary

Perovskite-perovskite 2-terminal tandem solar cells require the simultaneous development of narrow and wide band gap perovskite solar cells which can be fully integrated. We propose CsPbI\({}_{3}\) QD solar cells as a novel material for the wide band gap absorber due to their promising performance, extremely low \(V_{OC}\) deficit, and the absence of halide phase segregation which plagues I/Br\({}^{\prime}\) alloys. The high transmission and low voltage loss of CsPbI\({}_{3}\) QD solar cells in this work shows their potential. Moreover, the fact that these materials are processed from non-polar organic solvents, such as octane and methyl acetate, could facilitate 2-terminal tandem solar cell processing and perhaps remove the need for a TCO barrier layer between the two subcells.[9] With the advances shown, the realization of perovskite tandem solar cells with performance surpassing Si is well within reach.
