###### Abstract

In this paper, we present a method of reconstructing multiband signals with the arbitrary Spectrum Support Function. The signal reconstruction method is based on the theorem of Minimum Energy Reconstruction which is extended for multiband signals. The method allows the use of low sampling rates close to the Landau rate to achieve the goal. Signal samples are collected by using Periodic Nonuniform Sampling. The work is a direct extension of the previous research on Periodic Nonuniform Sampling. We propose to use two Analog to Digital Converters operating in parallel for alternatively collecting the samples. In comparison with the Periodic Nonuniform Sampling based on single Analog to Digital Converter, the proposed method can significantly improve the quality of signal processing.

## I Introduction

Digital Alias-free Signal Processing (DASP) aims at using nonuniform sampling to suppress the effect of aliasing. DASP provides means of processing signals in wide frequency ranges that are not limited by the half sampling rate. For traditional DSP, normally the Spectrum Support Function (SSF) of the processed signals is the given information. In the context of DASP, this information is unknown or partially known. Hence, DASP focuses on processing the signals with arbitrary SSFs. In comparison with traditional DSP, DASP can provide signal processing solutions with lower sampling rates for such problems [1]-[2]. This feature makes DASP a suitable tool for solving signal processing problems at wide frequency ranges for which maintaining high sampling rate is not viable either from technical or economic point of view. One of the earliest ideas of DASP has been reported in [1]. In that paper Shapiro and Silverman have shown that with use of random sampling it was possible to estimate the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of stationary signals. This effect was achievable even if the bandwidth of the signal exceeded arbitrarily much half of the average sampling frequency. Thorough reviews of various DASP techniques can be found in [2]-[4]. Reported applications of DASP include spectral analysis [5]-[11] and software radio [3]. As mentioned before, DASP requires that the analyzed signals are sampled nonuniformly. However, not each nonuniform sampling scheme is suitable for DASP. The processing algorithms used by DASP are typically more complex than those used in classical DSP. Therefore, DASP is mainly recommended for high frequency applications [8] where traditional approaches cannot be deployed due to excessive demands on the high sampling rates.

In the paper, we revisit a method that allows signal reconstruction of bandpass signals using low average sampling rates close to Landau rate [2]-[3] by using Periodic Nonuniform Sampling (PNS) while the instantaneous sampling rates are kept under control to match the capabilities of used hardware. PNS has been recommended for use in DSP in many publications [6], [8] and [9]-[12]. The extension of the proposed method is based on derivation of Minimum Energy Reconstruction (MER) method [13] for reconstructing bandpass signals and the use of a sampling scheme that utilizes two Analog to Digital Converters (ADC) working in parallel. In order to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method, we compare the proposed method with the method based on single-ADC PNS.

In section II we introduce the derivation of MER for bandpass signals with arbitrary SSF. Some properties of the proposed PNS are discussed in section III. In section IV, two numerical examples are presented to illustrate the methodology advocated in this paper.

## II Derivation of MER for Signals with Arbitrary SSF

Traditionally MER only considers baseband signals. In this paper the theorem of MER is extended for non-baseband signals. The problem of reconstructing a signal from its samples can be formulated as follows. Given a finite number of signal samples \(x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{N}\) taken at the time instants, \(t_{1},t_{2},...,t_{N}\) construct a continuous-time signal \(x(t)\) such that

\[X(f)S(f)=X(f) \tag{1}\]

and

\[x(t_{n})=x_{n}\,. \tag{2}\]

Function \(S(f)\) in (1) is referred to as SSF of the reconstructed signal. SSF is a function which depicts thefrequency occupancy of the signal spectrum. The SSF is an even function and maps the frequency axis into a two-element set: {0,1}. It indicates which frequencies may appear in the signal (the function takes value 1 at these frequencies) and which do not appear in the signal (the function takes value 0 at these frequencies). In the context of DASP, the conservative SSF is normally deployed. Conservative SSF is used when "a priori" the accurate SSF is not known. It indicates that it is set to value 1 when the actual value is not known. The inverse Fourier transform of \(S(f)\) is referred to as the constructing function, \(s(t)\). In Figure 1 the conservative SSF (a) and SSF (b) are shown for a sample signal and the continuous-time signal spectrum is shown in (c). In this paper signals for which only conservative SSF is available will be often dealt with.

For the purpose of constructing the model of signal \(x(t)\) whose spectrum is supported by \(S(f)\), the following is used:

\[x(t)=T\sum_{k=\infty}^{\infty}b_{k}s(t-kT). \tag{3}\]

where the constructing function \(s(t)\) is the inverse Fourier transform of \(S(f)\) and \(T\) is the inverse of the Nyquist rate \(f_{s}=2f_{\max}\). In the case of baseband signal its SSF is given by

\[S(f)=\mathbf{rect}\!\left(\frac{f}{2f_{\max}}\right)=\begin{cases}1&\text{ when }\left|f\right|\leq f_{\max}\\ 0&\text{ when }\left|f\right|>f_{\max}\end{cases}. \tag{4}\]

and the constructing function is

\[s(t)=2f_{\max}\text{sinc}(2f_{\max}t). \tag{5}\]

By choosing \(b_{k}=x(kT)\) in (3) any baseband signal can be perfectly reconstructed. In this case the energy of the signal \(E\) can be expressed in three versions:

\[E=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x^{2}(t)dt=T\sum_{k=\infty}^{\infty}x^{2}(kT)=T\sum_ {k=\infty}^{\infty}b_{k}^{2}. \tag{6}\]

Yen [13] used (3) and \(b_{k}=x(kT)\) in (3) for representing the class of all signals whose SSF is (4) and then searched for the signal that was identical with the measured values \(x_{1}\),\(x_{2}\),...,\(x_{N}\) at the sampling instants and for which the performance index \(J=\sum_{k=\infty}^{\infty}b_{k}^{2}\) reached minimum. However, the similar approach cannot be directly used when processing non-baseband signals. For many of such signals a special case of (3), Shannon's reconstruction formula, is not a unique model regardless of how the sampling interval \(T\) is selected. In other words, for the given \(x(t)\) and non-aliasing sampling rate \(f_{s}=1/\,T\) one can always construct various sequences \(b_{k}\sum_{k=\infty}^{\infty}\) such that (3) is satisfied. In those cases, selecting coefficients \(b_{k}\) as signal samples \(b_{k}=x(kT)\) is only one of many possibilities. Therefore in general \(E\neq T\sum_{k=\infty}^{\infty}b_{k}^{2}\) and it is no longer obvious that by minimizing cost \(J=\sum_{k=\infty}^{\infty}b_{k}^{2}\) the energy of the signal is really minimized. In the following the theorem of MER for non-baseband signals is presented. The following is denoted:

MHz using (11). The magnitude of \(X_{d}(f)\) estimated from single ADC PNS and two-ADC PNS are shown in Figure 2 and 3. As seen from each figure, there are two clearly identifiable bandpass components. However, the spectrum estimated from two-ADC PNS has better signal to noise ratio than that of single ADC PNS. In comparison with single ADC PNS, two-ADC PNS has more sufficient suppression of the effects of aliasing. In order to achieve better signal to noise ratio, one can easily obtain this by increasing the number of samples within one period.

Using the results presented in Figure 3 the more accurate approximation of the SSF (though still conservative) can be obtained:

\[S(f)=\begin{bmatrix}1,\left|f\right|\in[70,85]\cup[90,105]\text{MHz}\\ 0,\left|f\right|\in[70,85]\cup[90,105]\text{MHz}\end{bmatrix}\,.\]

Note that its bandwidth is 30MHz, much less than half of the sampling rate. Therefore the MER developed for non-baseband signals in section II can be effectively used to reconstruct the signal. Figure 4 shows the magnitude of the spectrum of MER that is constructed from the collected data of two-ADC PNS and the refined SSF. As seen from the plot, the ripples are the result of signal windowing and the plot is consistent with the shape of the spectrum of the continuous-time signal truncated to the observation window.

## V Conclusions

In this paper the methodology of MER has been extended for reconstructing non-baseband signals. The design of two-ADC PNS has been discussed. It shows that properly designed two-ADC PNS improves the level of suppressing aliases in the signal spectrum of the sampled signal. In the context of DASP, the approach of reconstructing sparse multiband signal spectrum consists of two stages. In the first stage, the conservative SSF is refined with the use of the samples collected by two-ADC PNS. In the second stage, the MER is used to reconstruct the sparse signal spectrum. In comparison with traditional DSP, the advocated DASP methodology allows reconstructing the multiband signals with arbitrary SSF at lower average sampling rates close to Landau rates.

In the future work, the optimal method of designing two-ADC PNS will be investigated.

## Appendix A

This appendix considers the MER for signals with SSF other than baseband. This is a direct extension of Yen's approach [13] which was intended for baseband signals only.

It is shown that if \(\left\{b_{k}\right\}_{k=\infty}^{\infty}\neq\left\{x(kT)\right\}_{k=\infty}^{\infty}\) then \(\sum_{k=\infty}^{\infty}b_{k}^{2}>\sum_{k=\infty}^{\infty}x(kT)\,.\) This relation is proved for \(T\leq 0.5/\,f_{\text{max}}\,.\) Let \(S(f)\) be a given SSF, \(\,f_{s}=1/\,T>2\,f_{\text{max}}\,\) be a sample rate and \(\left\{b_{k}\right\}_{k=\infty}^{\infty}\neq\left\{x(kT)\right\}_{k=\infty}^{\infty}\) be a sequence satisfying (3). An auxiliary SSF defined by \(\,\overline{S}(f)=\text{rect}\left(\frac{f}{2\,f_{\text{max}}}\right)\,\) is introduced. The constructing function appropriate to the above SSF is \(\,\)\(s(t)=\text{F}^{-1}(S(f))\,\) and \(\,\overline{s}(t)=2\,f_{\text{max}}\text{since}(2\,f_{\text{max}}t)\,\) respectively. Two representations of \(\,x(t)\,\) are formed:

\[x(t)=T\sum_{k=\infty}^{\infty}x(nT)s(t-kT)\,.\] (A.1)

The unknown coefficients \(\alpha_{n}\) can be obtained by substituting the sampling instants \(t_{n}\) in (A.12). It results in the following set of linear operations:

\[\begin{bmatrix}x_{1}\\ x_{2}\\ \vdots\\ x_{N}\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}s(\mathbf{0})&s(t_{1}-t_{2})&\cdots&s(t_{1}-t_{ N})\\ s(t_{2}-t_{1})&s(\mathbf{0})&\cdots&s(t_{2}-t_{N})\\ \vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\ s(t_{N}-t_{1})&s(t_{N}-t_{2})&\cdots&s(\mathbf{0})&\mathcal{L}_{N}\end{bmatrix}\] (A.13)

)

The following are denoted:

\[\mathbf{S}=\begin{bmatrix}s(\mathbf{0})&s(t_{1}-t_{2})&\cdots&s(t_{1}-t_{N})\\ s(t_{2}-t_{1})&s(\mathbf{0})&\cdots&s(t_{2}-t_{N})\\ \vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\ s(t_{N}-t_{1})&s(t_{N}-t_{2})&\cdots&s(\mathbf{0})\end{bmatrix}\] (A.14)

\[\mathbf{s}(t)=\begin{bmatrix}s(t-t_{1}),s(t-t_{2}),\cdots,s(t-t_{N})\end{bmatrix} ^{T}\,.\] (A.15)

\[\boldsymbol{\alpha}=\begin{bmatrix}\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2},\cdots,\alpha_{N} \end{bmatrix}^{T}\,.\] (A.16)

\[\mathbf{x}=\begin{bmatrix}x_{1},x_{2},\cdots,x_{N}\end{bmatrix}^{T}\,.\] (A.17)

With this notation (A.13) can be written as

\[\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{S}\boldsymbol{\alpha}\,.\] (A.18)

and the solution to this equation is

\[\boldsymbol{\alpha}=\mathbf{S}^{-1}\mathbf{x}\,.\] (A.19)

By combining this solution and (A.12) the MER for non-baseband signals is obtained

\[\boldsymbol{x}(t)=\boldsymbol{a}^{T}\mathbf{s}(t)\,.\] (A.20)
