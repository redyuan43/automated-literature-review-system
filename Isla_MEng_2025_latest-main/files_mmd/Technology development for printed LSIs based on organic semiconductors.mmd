The carrier transport mechanism in such a "soft solid" is not well understood at present. Recently, progress has been made in the development of organic semiconductor transistors with high mobilities of the order of 10 cm\({}^{2}\)/Vs. Since this is one order of magnitude higher than the value of about 1 cm\({}^{2}\)/Vs for conventional organic semiconductors, it raises expectations for next-generation semiconductor devices.

In the case of silicon, which is strongly covalent, electrons are delocalized among the orbitals of covalent bonds as shown in Fig. 2a, and band transport takes place. Therefore, the effective mass of electrons is a few tenths of the mass of free electrons, depending upon the bandwidth. In an organic semiconductor, however, where molecules are held together by weak intermolecular forces, the degree of orbital overlap is much smaller, and is more strongly affected by molecular vibrations even at room temperature. Such vibrations have a detrimental effect on carrier transport. (Fig. 1b). In other words, although the softness of the material makes it flexible and allows easy low-temperature fabrication, it also makes it difficult to produce devices that exhibit both high mobility and high performance. In order to achieve this, it is first necessary to understand microscopic carrier transport.

### _Hall effect in organic semiconductors_

Before the year 2000, the reported mobility values for organic transistors (organic FETs) were not very high, the largest being about 1 cm\({}^{2}\)/Vs for a pentacene (Fig. 3a) polycrystalline thin film that was prepared by vacuum evaporation [1]. In many polycrystalline thin films, the mobility showed a tendency to decrease with temperature, so that conduction is thought to occur by hopping transport. In the present century, however, many organic transistors with mobilities exceeding 1 cm\({}^{2}\)/Vs have been reported, starting with single-crystal organic semiconductor transistors [2] and including transistors based on newly synthesized organic semiconductors [3-7]. For such materials, mobility is found to increase at temperatures lower than room temperature, which led to the suggestion that carrier transport could be occurring through band conduction, in which carriers are delocalized between molecules [8].

Despite the fact that the Hall coefficient is one of the most basic carrier transport properties, a considerable amount of time passed before it was measured for organic transistors. In inorganic transistors such as those made from silicon, the carrier concentration and mobility have been accurately determined using the Hall measurements, and important information concerning the conduction mechanism has been obtained for amorphous materials. Therefore, the development of effective measurement methods for organic FETs has been strongly desired. In past organic thin film transistors, the impedance was at least 1 M\(\Omega\), so that satisfactory detection sensitivity could not be achieved.

In 2005, for the first time, Hall measurements using a high-mobility rubrene single-crystal FET were achieved [9, 10]. The measurement precision has subsequently been improved, and the technique has since been applied to a variety of high-mobility organic semiconductors [11-14]. The Hall effect occurs due to the Lorentz force exerted by a magnetic field \(B\) on a continuous flow of carriers (current) \(I_{D}\); therefore, the presence of delocalized carriers is assumed. Thus, when the dominant carrier transport mechanism is hopping conduction, it is extremely difficult to measure the electromotive force due to the Hall effect. The Hall coefficient \(R_{H}\), which is determined from the transverse voltage (Hall voltage) \(V_{H}\), using the expression \(R_{H}=V_{H}/(I_{D}\,B)\), is linked to charge per unit area \(Q\) by the relation \(R_{H}=1/Q\) under conditions of low inelastic scattering, when the carriers are free-electron-like and the electronic states are defined by the wavenumber. On the other hand, in the case of hopping conduction, \(V_{H}\) becomes much smaller in the absence of the transverse electromotive force. In fact, for low-mobility amorphous silicon, \(V_{H}\) is only 1/10 of that for free-electron-like transport [15].

Figure 4 shows the results of the Hall measurements. The reciprocal of the Hall coefficient \(1/R_{H}\) is plotted with respect to the gate voltage \(V_{G}\), and it is compared with \(Q\) estimated from the capacitance of the gate insulating layer and \(V_{G}\). It is obvious that the two sets of values are in good agreement, giving a clear evidence that holes injected by the field effect do not become localized in the molecules but are widely distributed among the molecules. From the dependence of the four-terminal conductivity \(\sigma\) on the gate voltage, also shown in Fig. 4, the mobility in this device was about 8 cm\({}^{2}\)/Vs. Based on the results of temperature dependent Hall measurements,

Podzorov et al. also reported band-type conductivity for a rubrene single-crystal transistors [10]. Later, the carrier delocalization in rubrene single-crystal FETs was also identified using other experimental methods. Low-energy Drude-type conductivity is successfully detected based on the results of light absorption measurements [16]. Recently, Ishii et al., carried out angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy of rubrene single crystals, and observed a clear band dispersion [17]. Applying the same experiment to other high-mobility organic semiconductors, including newly synthesized compounds, it turned out that band transport is realized in semiconductor s of many other molecules as shown in Fig. 3c-f.

## 2 Devices of solution crystallized organic semiconductors

### _Inch-size solution-processed organic crystal films of C10-DNBDT_

Solution processes such as printing attracts considerable attention for next-generation electronics industry because of simple and high-throughput fabrication without conventional vacuum processes, which are not cost-effective for large-area devices Conventional techniques such as spin coating and drop casting can be easily applied to large-area device fabrication. However, the performance of OFETs based on these conventional methods is still not satisfactory; the typical carrier mobility reported for solution-processed OFETs remains on the order of 0.1 cm\({}^{2}\)/Vs because the presence of grain boundaries and the random molecular orientation can hinder charge transport.

To improve the periodicity in the alignment of the molecules, we have developed a method for creating highly crystalline organic semiconductor films which increases the carrier mobility of solution-processed thin-film transistors (TFTs) by more than one order of magnitude, to 5-10 cm\({}^{2}\)/Vs [14, 18]. The method uses an edge to control the shape of an attached droplet, so that the thickness of the liquid gradually decreases as the distance from the solid edge increases. This method controls the direction of the crystal growth through the asymmetrical evaporation of the solvent, and allows continuous uniform crystalline films to be formed up to sub-millimeter sizes.

We recently modified the edge-casting solution-crystallization technique for producing much larger single-crystalline films by controlling the crystal growth direction [19]. A mobile solid blade edge is used to hold an organic semiconductor droplet in a rectangle, so that level-contour lines of the liquid-gas boundary, measured from the horizontal surface of the substrate, were parallel to the edge of the blade. The rectangular droplet was kept at the same size by replenishing the organic semiconductor solution at the same rate as the solvent evaporation.

A new organic semiconductor material 3,11-didecyl dinaphtho[2,3-d:2,'3-d']benzo[1,2b:4,5b']dithiophene [C10-DNBDT; Fig. 3f] is synthesized to produce chemically stable high-mobility organic crystal semiconductor films [7]. Indeed, this material exhibits excellent mobilities of up to 16 cm\({}^{2}\)/Vs for single-crystal transistors. For the present experiment to fabricate the large-area films, the C10-DNBDT solution was purchased from Pi-Crystal Inc.. Figure 5a shows the setup for growing the C10-DNBDT single-crystalline thin films. The substrates can be either glasses or plastics.

The stage was moved slowly in the direction indicated in the figure to grow the thin-film crystals at the edge of the blade. As the result, square crystals greater than 5 x 5 cm\({}^{2}\) in size were obtained. Very uniform features are visible in the optical micrograph of the thin film in Fig. 5b. Under a cross-polarized optical microscope, the brightness of the thin film abruptly changes when the sample was rotated, which is an indication of fully aligned molecular arrays in the organic crystalline "wafers".

### _Patterning processes of C10-DNBDT crystalline transistors_

The next step toward the goal of producing pLSIs is to establish reliable processes for drawing integrated circuits. In parallel to the recent progress in material development, we note some of the high-mobility compounds are gaining improved chemical stability against oxidation, which was not realized for conventional materials such as pentacene [1]. Importantly, such chemical robustness not merely contributes to elongated life time of the devices but possibly to durability against fabrication processes to make practically useful and high-performance devices. In order to fabricate reliable low-resistance electric contacts with organic semiconductor films within the micrometer-scale precision, we have developed a reliable method using photolithography directly on the high-mobility and chemically stable organic compounds.

A micro-patterning process is successfully demonstrated based on photolithography with simple wet-etching of gold electrodes deposited directly on pristine organic films without any adverse effect of residual photoresist. Since the wet-etching of gold is governed by iodide/iodine redox reaction, it is essential to use organic semiconductor materials that are robust to the reaction. Employing a newly developed chemically stable high-mobility organic semiconductor

materials C\({}_{10}\)-DNBDT with tuned ionization potential, these processes turned out to be suited to fabricate fine-pitch electrodes with low contact resistance.

Figure 6a and b shows transfer and output characteristics of the devices with directly wet-etched gold electrodes, indicating excellent performance with the channel length down to 5 \(\upmu\)m. Employing the transfer-line method, the contact resistance is evaluated to be \(\sim\) 100 \(\Omega\), which is nearly the minimum value reported for organic transistors. As the result of using high-mobility organic semiconductor film and shortening the channel length, the cut-off frequency of 19 MHz is demonstrated for the p-type transistors.

### Demonstration of AMLCDs and RFID tags

For a visible demonstration, we fabricated OFETs-driven active-matrix liquid crystal displays (AMLCD). Top-contact OFETs with a solution crystalized C\({}_{10}\)-DNBDT active layer were adopted to drive 60\(\times\)128 pixel AMLCD. Figure 7a shows a photograph of the developed AMLCD, and Fig. 7b shows an optical micrograph of each pixel. Source/drain electrodes, pixel electrodes and data electrodes were fabricated through consecutive patterning steps with the etching solution. The carrier mobility was measured for six devices and was estimated to be \(\sim\) 3.5 cm\({}^{2}\)/Vs (Fig. 8). We have demonstrated successful operations of the active matrix at the frequency of 360 Hz, which is 6 times faster than the normal speed in driving the gate lines. The result is attributed to the high-carrier mobility of the patterned organic semiconductors with the wet-etched source and drain electrodes.

Currently, the technology to implement both p- and n-type organic semiconductors are under development, so that integrated CMOS circuits are designed on plastic substrates using printing methods. Employing a chemically stable n-type organic semiconductor compound, we already found that the same process of the wet-etch patterning is applicable. Figure 9a shows an example of a flip-flop circuit based on the printed CMOS. Furthermore, we have demonstrated successful RF communication with 13.56 MHz signals, for the first time employing printed semiconductors (Fig. 9b); the devices are fabricated incorporating the printed CMOS ring oscillators and printed rectifiers based on high-mobility p-type organic crystal semiconductors. As the result of the demonstration, it is evidenced that the printed organic rectifiers were fast enough to catch up the RF-communication frequency and that the power consumption of the printed organic CMOS circuits were small enough to be operated by the DC power supplied by the rectifiers.
