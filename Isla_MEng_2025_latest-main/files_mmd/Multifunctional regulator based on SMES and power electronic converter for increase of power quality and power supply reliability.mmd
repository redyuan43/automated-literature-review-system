## I Introduction

Now there is an increase in the number of alternative energy sources in power systems. Especially it refers to the photovoltaic and wind power plants. Owing to the growth of distributed generation it is necessary to use electric energy storages. The active power transfer from alternative sources and energy storages to the grid is ensured by the regulators based on power electronic converters. Also such regulators enable to solve many problems relating to the power quality improvement. The significant reactive power consumption and voltage deviations are typical problems of industrial power systems. The residential power systems are featured by nonsinusoidal and unsymmetrical phase currents caused by a great number of nonlinear consumers and unbalanced load of three-phase system. These problems results in reduction of power transfer capability, auxiliary power loss, decrease of power quality, increase of the current in neutral wire in three-phase systems. It is known the realization of power quality regulators (reactive power compensators and active filters) based on capacitive energy storages (accumulator batteries and electrolytic capacitors). The advance in superconducting technologies and reduction in cost of materials can result in increase of superconducting magnetic energy storages (SMES) application. SMES is prospective energy storage since it has high energy capacity range, fast response, high efficiency and also high current carrying ability [1]. Inductive storages could be applied in power-supply systems of industrial plants for the purpose of reactive power compensation, ensuring of electric motors transient stability, matching of alternative sources with mains and also in uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems for process loads.

The converter is a power electronic interface between the ac power system and SMES. Converters based on the self-commutated devices (IGBT, IGCT, GTO) enable to control active and reactive power simultaneously. Using of pulse-width modulation (PWM) ensures the harmonic free currents or voltages. Thus the developed multifunctional regulator ensures the high accuracy control of reactive power according to the given algorithm. Also it can be used for the purpose of the enhancement of power system transient stability. For example it consumes the power in the case of system emergency or damps the active power oscillations after the emergency. The capabilities of active filtering, current balancing and voltage regulation enable to use such regulator for improve of power quality.

## II Converter Circuit

There are two topologies of converters used in SMES systems. The first one consists of voltage-source ac-dc PWM converter, dc-link capacitor and dc-dc chopper. The PWM chopper transfers the energy between the capacitor and superconducting coil. Another type of converter is current-source ac-dc PWM converter. In this case the coil voltage ripple is much smaller and the transfer of power between storage and power network is very fast [2].

Three-phase bridge converter (three-level topology) is the base circuit of SMES regulator (Fig. 1(a)). The dc-side of converter is directly connected with inductive storage. The ac-side is connected to the power network through CL-filter that reduces the high-order harmonics of the converter current. The switching devices of the converter are IGBT's with serial diodes that ensure unidirectional current on dc-side. The four-quadrant converter can operate as a rectifier, an inverter or/and a source of reactive power. The three-phase current at the ac-side is formed by the modulation of SMES current. The current in each phase of the converter is created by the switching between positive (+\(f_{3}\)), negative (-\(f_{3}\)) and zero value. The diagram of phase current at the ac-side of bridge converter is shown in Fig. 1(b). In this figure also the diagram of dc-side voltage in the inverter mode is shown. The average value of dc-side voltage as well as the magnitude of fundamental current component depends on the modulation index. The using of PWM enables to control the magnitude, the phase and the frequency of the current. Respectively the mean value of dc-side voltage can be positive in inverter mode, negative in rectifier mode and null in the case of reactive power regulation. So the regulator can realize different functions using the proper control algorithm.

For high power applications the multilevel converter structure is preferable for the power conditioning system of SMES. The using of multilevel topologies makes it possible to decrease the current harmonic distortion and at the same time to increase the power rating of regulator. In [3] three families of multilevel current-source converter topologies are derived, including three-phase single-rating inductor converter constructed by easily parallel of multiple bridges. Fig. 1(c) illustrates the 5-level converter circuit that consists of two bridge modules and four balance inductors. These inductors have the same inductance and the SMES current is equally divided between modules, so the current of each inductor is \(I_{S}/2\). Thus we have simultaneously the amplitude-modulated and pulse-width modulated current in each phase. The diagram of the two-module PWM converter output current is given in Fig. 1(d). The frequency of modulation harmonics is two times less than the switching frequency, so we can use easier CL-filter at the ac-side of the converter. In addition we can minimize the modulation frequency for the purpose of the power loss limiting in switching devices.

## III Control System

The converter control system defines the regulator efficiency and its functionality. The main functions are the control of reactive power (regulation of cosp), regulation of active power for the purpose of enhancement of transient stability of power system, and the keeping of load nominal voltage in the case of power failure (operation as uninterruptible power supply). The active filtering of the major current harmonics of nonlinear load and the network currents balancing in the case of unsymmetrical load are considered as additional functions. In order to ensure the all required functions and respective control algorithms the control system should be realized with high speed microcontroller. The input signals of the control system are the load current (\(l_{t(ab)}\)), the converter current (\(l_{C(ab)}\)), the voltages at the connection point (\(u_{(ab)}\)), and the SMES current (\(I_{S}\)) measured by current and voltage sensors. The control system consists of two main parts: the current regulation unit and the modulation unit.

The generalized block diagram of the current regulation unit is presented in Fig. 2(a). The function of this unit is the calculation of the reference signals of converter current (\(i_{C(ab)}\)). The control algorithms are based on abc/dq-t-transformation of voltages and currents [4]. The current regulation unit (Fig. 2(a)) involves the synchronization system (Synchr.). This system generates the unit signal that corresponds with the measured voltage (has the same frequency and phase). The digital low-pass filters (LPF) are necessary to calculate the constant components of the dq-signals of currents.

Figure 1: The topology of regulator based on 3-level current-source converter (CSC) (a): the diagrams of ac-side current and dc-side voltage (b): the 5-level converter circuit (c) and the diagram of its phase current (d).

Fig. 2(b, c) illustrates the block diagrams of the converter current calculation algorithm for three regulator functions: reactive power compensation, active filtering and control of load voltage. In the active/reactive power regulation modes or voltage control for abc/dq-transformation the network frequency is used. In this case the dq-signals correspond to the fundamental component of current. For load reactive power compensation the reference current is only \(q\)-component. In case of the network currents balancing the abc/dq-transformation for inverse sequence of currents is used.

In the active filtering operation mode the abc/dq-transformation is performed for the major harmonics of current. Therefore harmonic synchronizing signals are calculated. For the 5th and 11th harmonics the abc/dq-transformation for inverse sequence is performed (Fig. 2(b)). The reference dq-signals correspond to magnitudes of the 5th, 7th and 11th harmonics of the load current. In case of the load voltage control in UPS mode the converter current regulation is made by voltage feedback (Fig. 2(c)). Reference currents are calculated by proportional-plus-integral controller. The input of PI controller is the difference of the measured voltage and the nominal voltage (required value) in dq-frame.

In order to compensate the effect of CL-filter on the dynamic processes and the steady-state current error it is necessary to have auxiliary control channel to regulate the output converter voltage and current.

The function of modulation unit is the generation of control pulses for switching devices. This unit realizes the space-vector modulation technique (SV-PWM) [4]. In this case the space vector of converter current (\(I_{c}^{*}\)) is controlled by the switching of the base and the zero vectors during the PWM period (Fig. 3(a)). There are six base vectors and three zero vectors. In Fig. 3(a) A+, B+, C+ are the upper switches of bridge CSC (Fig. 3(a)) and A-, B-, C- are the lower switches. Every base vectors (1)-(6) correspond with the ON-state of two switches in different legs of converter, and the zero currents correspond with the ON-state of switches in the same leg (zero vectors (7)-(8)). The input reference signals of modulation unit (Fig. 3(b)) are scaled to the value of the measured storage current \(I_{S}\). Then the sector number (from I to VI) is calculated. The scaled signals of current are converted into two-phase form using abc/q-transformation. Taking into account the sector number the modulating signals are calculated. The diagrams of these signals and the switching pulses are shown in Fig. 3(c). The duration of every sector is \(\pi/3\). The width of switching pulses determines the action period of two base vectors of the sector during the sample time \(T_{S}\): the operation time of one vector is increased, while the operation interval of second vector is decreased, null intervals correspond to zero vector of the sector. So in sector I duty ratio of base vector 1 is decreased and the one of vector (2) is increased, while in sector II duration of pulses of base vector (2) is decreased and duty ratio of vector (3) is increased as shown in Fig. 3(c). Zero state in sector I is vector (7) and null intervals in sector II correspond to ON-state of switches C+, C- (zero vector (9)). The programmable logic device is used for distribution of the derived switching pulses for IGBITS. Also the storage current continuity is ensured. In the case of 5-level converter it is necessary to use two carrier signals (for each of the bridge modules). These triangle signals have the phase shifting equal to \(T_{5}/2\).

Using of SV-PWM enables to increase the application efficiency of the inductive storage. Magnitude of the fundamental component of the converter current (\(I_{\mathrm{C1,n}}\)) and mean value of the dc-side voltage (\(U_{dc,\,4r}\)) are defined as:

- for SV-PWM:

\[I_{\mathrm{C1,n}}=I_{S}\cdot M,\ U_{dc,\,4r}=\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}\cdot U_{S} \cdot M\cos\varphi; \tag{1}\]

- for Sin-PWM:

\[I_{\mathrm{C1,n}}=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}I_{S}\cdot M,\ U_{dc,\,4r}=\frac{3}{2 \sqrt{2}}\cdot U_{S}\cdot M\cos\varphi, \tag{2}\]

where \(U_{S}\) is the RMS value of phase-to-phase voltage, \(M\) is the modulation index, \(\varphi\) is the phase angle between phase voltage and converter current. Dependence of the dc-side voltage mean value vs. angle \(\varphi\) for \(M\) = 1 is shown in Fig. 4. The quadrants I and IV correspond to inverter operation mode and in the quadrants II and III converter operates in the rectifier mode (storing energy in SMES). Thus we have higher dc-side voltage and fundamental component of current using the space-vector modulation instead of sinusoidal PWM. In modes of active power consumption/generation (\(\varphi\)=180\({}^{\circ}\) and \(\varphi\)=0\({}^{\circ}\)) the relative value of dc-side voltage is equal to 1.06 for sinusoidal PWM. For space-vector PWM the voltage is 15% higher (\(U_{dc,\,4r}\) = 1.22\(U_{S}\)), i.e. at the same voltage we can transfer more active power to the network.

## 4 Simulation Results

The simulation of different operation modes and functions of the regulator were made in _MatLab/Simulink_ program. The current-source converter was modeled as three-phase GTO thyristor based bridge converter. The storage unit was modeled as an inductive element with set of the initial inductor current. For example simulation results of the regulator in active filtering and uninterruptible power supply (UPS) operation modes are considered.

The main advantage of UPS based on SMES is the capability to supply the load with very high consumption current. The high energy capacity of the storage makes it possible to have load currents up to 10 kA during 10 s. It is very important for some technological power consumers. The simulation results for UPS mode are shown in Fig. 5(a). At the moment \(t\) = 0.04 s the network power supply interruption is occurred. The load begins to consume active power from the regulator. Control of the converter current is realized by means of the load voltage feedback. As a result the regulator generates the PWM current equal to the nominal load current, also the load voltage is restored to the nominal level (Fig. 5(a)). In this case the dc-side voltage is positive, the power is transferred from SMES to the load, and the converter operates as an inverter. As we can see from Fig. 5(a) the time of voltage restoration is not exceeds three periods of the fundamental component (0.06 s). The time response depends on converter control system characteristics: PI controller and LPF (see Fig. 2(c)).

The diagrams of currents and voltages for the active filter operation mode are given in Fig. 5(b). The nonsinusoidal load current contains the \(5^{\mathrm{th}}\) and the \(7^{\mathrm{th}}\) harmonics, which magnitudes reach about 60% and 35% of the fundamental component, respectively. Relative magnitudes of the \(11^{\mathrm{th}}\) and the \(13^{\mathrm{th}}\) harmonics are about 10%. This current waveform is a typical for the diode rectifier with RC-load. The regulator is turned on at the moment \(t\) = 0.02 s and begin to generate the current using the space-vector modulation technique with 5400 Hz switching frequency. The regulator compensates major harmonics of the load current (\(5^{\mathrm{th}}\), \(7^{\mathrm{th}}\), \(11^{\mathrm{th}}\) and \(13^{\mathrm{th}}\)). The network current becomes practically sinusoidal and it has only the modulation distortion. In the active filter mode as well as in the reactive power control and the current balancing modes, only nonactive power is transferred from the regulator to the power network. Therefore the mean value of the converter dc-side voltage is close to zero (Fig. 5(b)). In order to compensate the power loss in the regulator circuit and to have the constant storage current it is necessary to consume low active power. In order to compensate reactive power of CL-filter the PWM current contains the fundamental component besides higher harmonics.

The active power control for the purpose of transient stability enhancement of power system is the one of major functions of regulator with SMES. The transient stability can be perturbed after short-circuits, load surge and shedding, power line tripping and other disturbances. The scheme of simulated typical power system is shown in Fig. 5(c). The synchronous generator (SG) is connected with substation transformer (Tr1) and the regulator. The power is transferred

from SG to infinite power buses (\(U_{i}\)) by two transmission lines (L1, L2). Three-phase short-circuit at the beginning of line L2 is considered as a fault. The regulator enables to consume active power (\(P_{\text{SMES}}\)) storing the energy in SMES during the fault. After cutout of the damaged transmission line SG speed is reduced. Also oscillation of SG active power is arisen. Fig. 5(c) illustrates variation of the active power and phase angle \(\delta\) between SG voltage and \(U_{i}\) for three cases: 1 - the fault clearing time (\(t_{\text{eff}}\)) exceeds the actual value \(t_{\text{eff,\,or}}\) (for system with SMES); 2 - \(t_{\text{eff}}=t_{\text{eff,\,or}}\); 3 - \(t_{\text{eff}}=t_{\text{eff,\,or}}\) (for system without SMES). In the case (\(t_{\text{eff}}>t_{\text{eff,\,or}}\)) the system becomes unstable since at the moment of fault clearing angle \(\delta\) exceeds limiting value \(\delta_{\text{eff,\,lim}}\) and maximum value of \(\delta\) becomes more than critical value \(\delta_{\text{or,\,lim}}\). In the cases 2 and 3 the regulator consumes the power from SG starting from moment of the fault \(t=0.5\) s to moment \(0.5+t_{\text{eff}}\) (see Fig. 5(c)). Operation of the regulator in rectifying mode results in decrease of generator acceleration. It enables to have the more fault clearing time (\(t_{\text{eff,\,or}}>t_{\text{eff,\,or}}\)). As a result we can ensure transient stability of the power system using the regulator based on SMES [5].

Also the regulator operating in mode of periodical consuming and generating of active power can be used for damping of oscillations after the fault and after automatic recclosing of the damaged power line. It enables to maintain the transient stability and also rapidly restore normal operation mode of power system.

## V Conclusion

The regulator based on SMES and the current-source converter with self-commutated switches can realize several functions that enable to improve the power quality and increase the power supply reliability. The required characteristics of the regulator were verified with the simulation in _MatLab/Simulink_ program. Steady-state and transient behavior were studied. The main functions and operation modes were modeled: active and reactive power control, active filtering and voltage regulation in UPS mode. The proposed control algorithms based on SV-PWM technique ensure the operation of the regulator in different modes with high efficiency. The space-vector modulation of output converter current enables to make the best use of SMES.
