## II Experimental Methodology

Cu-Al bonding joints were fabricated on a Philcom 3 wire bonding platform. In an electronic flame-off (EFO) process, 50-\(\upmu\)m pure copper bonding wire (99.99%) purchased from Heraeus was used to produce FABs with 80-\(\upmu\)m ball diameters. The copper FABs were then thermosonically bonded to 4.1-\(\upmu\)m thick pure aluminum bonding pads, which were deposited on silicon chips using chemical vapor deposition. To prevent the oxidation of the copper, a forming gas consisting of 95% N\({}_{2}\) + 5% H\({}_{2}\) was used throughout the FAB fabrication process. Then an annealing process was introduced to accelerate IMC growth. Cu-Al bonds without EMC encapsulation were aged at a temperature of 310 \({}^{\circ}\)C for 20 min or 35 min with the protection of argon. As-bonded and aged Cu-Al bonding joints without EMC encapsulation were subjected to autoclave testing at the temperature of 130 \({}^{\circ}\)C for either 8 or 40 h. Three aqueous solutions were used in autoclave testing: deionized water, 0.1 mol/L HNO\({}_{3}\) solution, and 0.1 mol/L HCl solution.

The selected samples were cold mounted using epoxy. Cross-sectional samples were prepared and recorded using SEM (JOEL 6700F) and TEM (JOEL 2010F, 200 kV) combined with EDX to reveal IMC microstructure evolution and their corrosion behavior. The SEM cross-sections were prepared using successive mechanical grinding with emery paper up to #1200 to obtain the desired cross-section, followed by ion milling polishing using a Flat Ion Milling System (Hitachi IM-3000) to ensure that the cross-sections were stress free. To prepare the TEM samples, cross-sections that were approximately 20-\(\upmu\)m thick were mechanically abraded with emery paper that was up to 1-\(\upmu\)m grit. Ion milling thinning using a GATAN PIPS-691 Ion-Miller was then employed to prepare the electron-transparent specimens for TEM characterization.

## III Results and discussion

### _IMC formation in the Cu-Al bonds)_


### _Effect of aggressive ions on IMC corrosion in autoclave testing_

After autoclave testing, SEM incorporated with EDX detector was utilized to check the top surface of Cu ball bond units (Fig. 3). When deionized water was used in autoclave testing, the copper ball and aluminum bonding pad did not clearly oxidize, even after humidity testing was extended to 40 h (Fig. 3a). However, if the HCl solution was introduced, obvious pitting occurred on the surface of the aluminum pad after the Cu-Al bonds were exposed to the corrosion environment for only 8 h (secondary electron image, or SEI, in Fig. 3c). We speculated that pustules on the Al pad, which were rich in oxygen and chlorine (EDX mapping in Fig. 3c), were the pitting product (aluminum hydroxide) and may have been induced by the chloride [25]. In an acid humidity environment without chloride (using HNO\({}_{3}\) solution), pitting

### _The mechanism of selective IMC corrosion_

Based on above HRTEM images, the IMC dealloying mechanism was inferred, and is summarized in Fig. 10. When Cu\({}_{3}\)Al\({}_{2}\) or Cu\({}_{9}\)Al\({}_{4}\) came into contact with chloride (Fig. 10a),

## IV Conclusion

We systematically investigated the selective IMC corrosion of Cu-Al bonding joints using chloride-containing accelerated humidity testing under conditions of high temperature and humidity. Three layers of IMCs were obtained, in which Cu\({}_{3}\)Al\({}_{2}\) formed between the Cu\({}_{9}\)Al\({}_{4}\) and Al\({}_{5}\)Cu layers. Acid steam induced unselective interfacial Cu-Al IMC corrosion, but the introduction of chloride into the steam resulted in selective IMC corrosion with a high corrosion rate. Aluminum atoms in the corroded IMCs (Cu\({}_{9}\)Al\({}_{4}\) or Cu\({}_{3}\)Al\({}_{2}\)) were ionized and transformed into amorphous aluminum hydroxide. Nanoscale copper grains, following the process of heterogeneous nucleation and grain growth, were undercut from the Cu\({}_{3}\)Al\({}_{2}\) and Cu\({}_{9}\)Al\({}_{4}\) matrices and released into the amorphous aluminum hydroxide. A bilayer nanostructure, consisting of aluminum and alumina, formed on the surface of the Al\({}_{2}\)Cu and ensured the intactness of Al\({}_{2}\)Cu during the corrosion process, thus facilitating selective IMC corrosion.
