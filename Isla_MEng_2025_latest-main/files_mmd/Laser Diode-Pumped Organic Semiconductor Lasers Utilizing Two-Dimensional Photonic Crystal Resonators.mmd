## I Introduction

Organic semiconductors have attracted much interest as active electroluminescent materials over recent years. Their spectrally broad emission range and high efficiency has prompted intense research towards organic laser devices. Optically pumped organic semiconductor lasers have been realized based on spin-coated conjugated polymer films as well as evaporated thin films of small organic molecules [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. These organic lasers were pumped by other gas or solid-state lasers such as frequency-doubled/tripled Nd\(\,\):YAG-lasers, nitrogen lasers, and complex femtosecond laser systems, resulting in a versatile but expensive laser source. However, for many applications, e.g., for laser-based analytical techniques and sensors, much more compact and inexpensive all solid-state pump laser sources are desirable. The recent evolution of blue-violet emitting inorganic laser diodes renders these devices attractive as pump sources for conjugated polymer lasers [9, 10, 11].

In this letter, we report on laser diode-pumped photonic crystal lasers utilizing thin films of the small molecule organic semiconductor tris-(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum (Alq\({}_{3}\)) doped with 2.2 wt\(\%\) of the laser dye 4-Dicyanomethylene-2-methyl-6-(p-dimethylaminostyryl)-4H-pyran (DCM) as the active gain medium. Low-threshold laser emission around 650 nm has been achieved using first- and second-order distributed feedback (DFB) in a two-dimensional photonic crystal resonator.

## II Device Structure and Optical Setup

A schematic cross-sectional view of the investigated organic semiconductor lasers is shown in the upper part of Fig. 1. To realize a laser resonator, we used two-dimensional photonic crystal lattices. Square lattices with periods of \(a=200\) nm and \(a=40\)0 nm were fabricated in order to provide first- and second-order feedback for the laser emission of DCM at about 650 nm. The gratings with a total size of \(320\)\(\mu\)m\(\times\)\(320\)\(\mu\)m were fabricated via dry etching of a 600-nm-thick silicon dioxide layer on a silicon wafer [12]. The height of the resulting SiO\({}_{2}\) pillars was \(h=70\) nm, with a radius of \(r=60\) nm. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) picture of an investigated first-order two-dimensional photonic crystal lattice is depicted in the lower part of Fig. 1. The organic semiconductor thin film (thickness \(\approx 360\) nm) was deposited on top of the substrate by thermal co-evaporation of Alq\({}_{3}\) and DCM (2.2 wt\(\%\)) in a high vacuum chamber (\(\approx 10^{-7}\) mbar). The resulting organic film exhibits a higher refractive index (\(n\approx 1.78\)) than the surrounding air-substrate, thus forming a planar waveguide.

Our pumping scheme is shown in Fig. 2. We used a conventional (In)GaN laser diode (\(\lambda=40\)8 nm, TopGaN) and a pulsed power supply (Sacher Laseretechnik, PP-9A) to produce laser pulses with a pulsewidth of 20 ns at a repetition rate of 16 Hz. When using such short pulsewidths, the laser diode can be driven at high peak current levels of more than 3 A resulting in an optical peak power of up to 3 W (see inset of Fig. 2). The output of the laser diode was collimated (aspheric lens, \(f=4.0\) mm) and then reflected into a microscope objective (Spindler&Hoyer, 20/0.35) using a dichroic mirror (Omega Optical, 410 DRLP). The resulting pump spot on the organic laser surface was roughly circular with a diameter of 90 \(\mu\)m. During the measurements, the organic lasers were kept in a nitrogen purge chamber to prevent degradation. The surface emission from the organic laser sample was collected and collimated by the microscope objective, sent through an emission filter (Omega Optical, 435 ALP), and focused into an optical fiber (Ocean Optics, P400-3-VIS/NIRFC), which was connected to a spectrometer equipped with an intensified charged-coupled device (CCD) camera (Princeton Instruments, PiMax:512).

## III Measurement Results and Discussion

Fig. 3 shows the emission spectra of a second-order laser at various currents supplied to the (In)GaN laser diode. For peak current values up to 1400 mA, a broad photoluminescence emission spectrum spanning from 550 to 700 nm is observed. Starting at a current of \(\approx 1500\) mA, a sharp laser peak at a wavelength of 647 nm evolves. The corresponding pump intensity at threshold is \(\approx\)3.2 kW/cm\({}^{2}\). For higher pump powers, the laser peak dominates the emission spectrum. The inset of Fig. 3 shows the input-output characteristic of the organic laser device.

Fig. 4 shows the data obtained for a first-order photonic crystal laser with a grating period of \(a=200\) nm. In this case, only scattered light is detected since the laser operates in the plane of the waveguide with no outcoupling perpendicular to the waveguide. The onset of lasing at a wavelength of 645 nm is detected for a current of \(\approx\) 1400 mA. The corresponding pump intensity is only \(\approx\)1.9 kW/cm\({}^{2}\) and is thus about a factor of two lower than the threshold of the second-order photonic crystal resonator. Above a current of \(\approx\) 1700 mA, a second laser peak (\(\lambda=642\) nm) evolves at the short-wavelength edge of the photonic stopband.

## IV Conclusion

In summary, we have realized a very compact all solid-state laser system using a low-cost pulsed (In)GaN laser diode. While a second-order photonic crystal laser bears advantages for applications where a surface-emitting laser is needed, a first-order laser enables an even reduced threshold, which can be favorably used, e.g., in sensing schemes relying on the evanescent field. The proposed lasers could be made mechanically tunable by either using a wedge-shaped organic thin-film with varying thickness or by use of grating matrices, i.e., by spatially varying the lattice period. Both concepts alter the emission wavelength when the photonic crystal laser is moved mechanically in a way that the pump laser diode excites a different region of the photonic crystal laser.

Such inorganic-organic hybrid laser systems could provide the basis for innovative portable analysis systems. In addition, the first-order system is a promising candidate for an even cheaper pumping scheme based on light-emitting diodes, which could lead to extremely low-cost and versatile laser sources emitting throughout the entire visible wavelength range.
