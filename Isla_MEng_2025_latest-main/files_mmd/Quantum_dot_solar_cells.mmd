###### Abstract

Quantum dot (QD)-based solar cells have been the subject of over two decades of research with the hopes of increasing their efficiency to surpass single junction solar cells. To date, no single working device has been developed that surpasses the efficiency of a single junction solar cell. Fundamental issues including unrealistic assumptions involved in theoretical work, tendency of stretching observed experimental results, and lack of both process and dimension control at nanoscale exist with QD-based solar cells making them unlikely to play a significant role in the manufacturing of future generations of PV modules. Silicon (Si)-based photovoltaics (PV) manufacturing will continue to provide sustained growth of the PV industry. This paper presents a review of the fundamental problems associated with QD-based solar cells.

## I Introduction

Free fuel based PV and wind energy are the only sustainable solutions that can meet the growing energy demands. Due to inherent advantages, PV will take over wind energy and eventually become the dominant electricity generation technology [1]. Without subsidy, PV has the lowest cost of electricity generation on earth [2]. In [3], it is given that the power of the solar farm is 1.177 gigawatt, capital cost is $872 million, area is 7.8 square kilometers, and the cost to customer is 2.42cents/kWh. From these figures, the installed PV system cost can be calculated as $0.74 per watt.

Bulk Si-based solar cells provide the best conversion efficiencies reaching as high as 26.3% for single junction [4] and 31.3% for multijunction Si-based solar cells [5]. The conversion efficiency of bulk Si-based solar is limited by the thermalization of photogenerated carriers in the crystal lattice [6], thermodynamic losses, and unabsorbed photons [7] (Fig. 1).

## II Nanostructure Fundamentals

Properties of materials differ in nanoscale dimensions (Fig. 3). If these materials can be successfully manufactured, these properties may be utilized to enhance solar energy conversion efficiency. In the last couple of decades, people have been trying to utilize the quantum confinement property of these nanostructures to yield high-efficiency solar cells [12].

These nanostructures can be classified as one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D), three-dimensional (3D) and zero-dimensional (0D). 1D nanostructures have only one dimension that is significantly larger than the other two. Examples of 1D structures include polymers. 2D nanostructures have two dimensions that are significantly larger than the third. Examples of 2D structures include thin films. 3D nanostructures are honeycomb-like structures or a matrix formed by aggregation of nanoparticles. 0D structures have all dimensions nanometers wide. Quantum confinement brings about a change in all of the classes as mentioned above (Fig. 3). Consider a 0D structure where all dimensions are a few nanometers, the density of states in this structure will be quantized in all three dimensions. Now consider a 2D structure where only one dimension is in nanoscale range, the density of states in this structure will be quantized in only a single dimension [12].

Researchers have been able to utilize these interesting properties in an isolated nanostructure, but they haven't been very successful in doing so in a device made from the same nanostructures. This is due to the presence of defects and large surface states (ratio of states on the surface of the nanomaterial is higher as compared to that present in the interior of the nanomaterial) [12].

## III Processing of Nanostructures

There are two technologies to manufacture a nanostructured device that are currently under consideration. The first is the top-down approach and the second is the bottom-up approach. The variabilities created in the critical dimension of the nanostructure by the processing technologies must be taken into account. Ideally, there should be no variability, or there must be uniformity in the critical dimension of the device (Fig. 4). Only then can a process be considered suitable. From Fig. 4, distribution A is the desired case whereas due to variability in the manufacturing process, we obtain distribution B [12].

### _Top-Down Approach_

Lithography has been the standard technique used in IC manufacturing for transferring patterns. The half pitch (minimum feature size) has been steadily decreasing since the 1980s. This change has been driven by the invention of new light sources and improved exposure methods. The current half pitch distance is 7nm and wavelength of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light source used is 13.5nm [14]. Top-down lithography can be done by two methods. The first is selective epitaxy (growing material on the required areas) and the second is selective etching (growing material over a large area and etching out unnecessary portions to create required structures) [12].

In addition to the surface patterning abilities as mentioned above, manufacturing will require profiling abilities along the vertical axis. The deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) can make vertical profiles with aspect ratios greater than 50. However, the successful manufacture of these devices on a large scale will depend upon the efficiency in tackling issues pertaining to process control and non-homogeneity. Additionally, if this approach is to be used by PV industry, major cost reduction is required for the high-cost lithography equipment used in IC industry [12].

### _Bottom-Up Approach_

Bottom-up approach is also known as self-assembly. Here the atoms or molecules are forced to assemble in a particular fashion chemically, mechanically or electrically. The use of this technique in semiconductor manufacturing is highly unlikely due to low growth rates and high defect densities associated with it. As compared to self-assembly, lithography based fabrication process results in structures with better homogeneity having much better process control [12].

## IV Use of Quantum Dots in Building Solar Cells

Quantum dots are three-dimensionally confined semiconductor nanocrystals [7]. These are 0D particles in which, due to quantization effects, the band structure is dependent on the particle size. Therefore, in theory, one can engineer an optimal bandgap for high efficiency solar cells

by varying the particle size appropriately [12]. QDs provide new techniques for efficient photoexcitation and charge separation by combining novel nanoscale properties with low cost and processability to improve solar energy conversion. Three general strategies have been proposed to incorporate QDs in solar cells. The first strategy is to use the QDs to sensitize wide-bandgap semiconductors. The second strategy is to place the QDs in intimate contact with electron or hole conducting polymers. The third strategy is to form QD arrays where the QDs are electronically coupled to allow for efficient electron/hole conductivity. The first two strategies are based on the close contact of the QDs with other materials to achieve charge separation and transport with the QDs acting as the light-absorbing component. The third strategy requires highly coupled QD-array for light absorption [7].

The use of Quantum Dots to build highly efficient solar cells is primarily based on the following two facts. First, additional current or voltage can be generated by employing hot carriers generated by absorbing photons of greater energy than bandgap energy. And second, carriers generated from photons having energy lower than the bandgap energy can be trapped by the energy states in the energy bandgap [13].

### _Hot Carriers to Increase Solar Cell Efficiency_

Solar Cells using hot carriers convert excess photon energies into stable form before the excited states can reach to an equilibrium state with the environment. This excess photon energy appears as kinetic energy of the carriers, in the case of semiconductors, and phonon that is dissipated as heat, in the case of molecules. When a photon having energy greater than the bandgap energy is incident on the cell, the electrons get excited, and thermalization occurs through phonon-carrier scattering (Fig. 5). This excess photon energy must be delivered to the bands sustaining the hot carriers for achieving high efficiency of the solar cell [13].

There are two techniques to do the same. First, before the device cools down, remove the carrier from it thereby obtaining a higher energy electron and thus a higher voltage output (Fig. 6). To make this possible, the rate of hot carrier separation, transport, and collection at contacts must be greater than the rate of cooling hot electrons [13].

The second approach involves the energized electron spending its excess energy to excite another electron from the valence band thereby obtaining a higher output current (Fig. 7). This is also known as impact ionization. This occurs only when the rate of relaxation process is less than the rate of impact ionization [13].

The use of QDs for utilizing these hot carrier effects has been investigated by various groups [15, 17]. Till date, there has been no experimental evidence to support the fact that for QDs, the rate of thermal cooling of hot carriers is slower than the rate of multiple carrier excitations [13].

### _Tandem Solar Cells_

The conventional solar cells use single energy bandgap materials. These materials cannot efficiently absorb the full solar spectrum. To enhance the solar cell efficiency, the use of layers of different bandgap materials has been suggested [18]. The perfect combinations of materials to absorb the entire solar spectrum have been researched upon

Fig. 5: Photon with energy (hv) greater than bandgap energy (E\({}_{g}\)) strikes on a solar cell, excites an electron to conduction band (CB) from valence band (VB), and releases the extra energy (hv-E\({}_{g}\)) as phonon [13].

Fig. 6: Photon with energy (hv) greater than bandgap energy (E\({}_{g}\)) strikes on a solar cell, excites an electron to conduction band (CB) from valence band (VB), and releases the extra energy (hv-E\({}_{g}\)), which is used to produce higher voltage by hv-E\({}_{g}\)[13].

Fig. 7: Photon with energy (hv) greater than bandgap energy (E\({}_{g}\)) strikes on a solar cell, excites an electron to conduction band (CB) from valence band (VB), and releases the extra energy (hv-E\({}_{g}\)), which is used to excite another electron from VB to CB [13].

extensively. Application of low-dimensional nanostructures, such as QDs, as an absorber layer in these solar cells, has been under consideration. A research group has shown an efficiency of 10.6% by embedding 3nm quantum dots in 2nm SiO\({}_{2}\) layers [19]. The efficiency obtained by the use of QDs in tandem solar cells is much lower than the efficiency of commercially available single junction silicon solar cells. Also, there are fundamental issues of reliability and heat removal that are associated with the use of QDs [20]. The complexity with the use of QDs in solar cells is further aggravated by the fact that for a silicon wafer of size 150mm, QDs in the order of quadrillion (\(10^{15}\)) will be required [21]. Another challenge is imposed by the control on the size distribution of QDs. When the size distribution is large, the interactions between the QDs increases resulting in reduced mobility and short circuit current. This happens due to charge carrier hopping between adjacent QDs [22].

### _Intermediate Band Solar Cells_

The basic concept of intermediate band solar cells (IBSCs) is to have an intermediate band to utilize the photons having lower energies from the solar spectrum. The concept is fundamentally against the recombination-generation principle where the performance of solar cells is degraded by the energy levels near the mid-gap. This has also been confirmed experimentally. Fig. 8 and 9 shows the dark and light current density-voltage characteristics of GaAs reference cell, GaAs IBSC solar cells based on QD with and without delta (\(\delta\)) doping of QD layers [23]. From these figures, it is clearly seen that the intermediate band layer degrades the solar cells performance.

## V Current Research Initiatives on Quantum Dot Solar Cells

Several research initiatives are underway to improve the efficiency of quantum dot solar cells. The following represent some of the most prominent in this field:

* Designing new solar cell structures and imbedding QD layers in the depletion region to improve the conversion efficiency [24]
* Suppressing thermal escape by using wide bandgap semiconductor, which increases the barrier height for quantum dots [25].
* Increasing quantum dot light absorption using epitaxial lift off devices with textured back surface reflectors [26].
* Suppressing forward bias dark current by optimizing carrier mobility and band alignment engineering, which improves open circuit voltage [27, 28].
* an undesired effect that contributes to the solar cell photocurrent [29].
* Improving the sub-bandgap photon absorption of QD based IBSC by doping the QDs with Si and using AlAs cap layers to prevent the formation of point defects [30].
* Investigating spectral response of two-step photon absorption in QD solar cells to improve both the photocurrent gain efficiency and the photofilling conditions [31, 32].
* Studying the degradation of the open circuit voltage of QD solar cells due to the Shockley-Queisser limit that fundamentally enhances the dark saturation current density [33].

## VI Conclusions

QD-based solar cells have been proposed as the future generation of PV modules. These claim to provide an increased efficiency primarily by multi-exciton generation, utilization of the unabsorbed part of the spectrum and reduced heat dissipation as compared to the conventional solar cell modules. Despite these claims, a working device has not been proposed. This is due to the following five fundamental physics-based criterions: First, we cannot neglect interactions between phonon and charge carriers. Second, hot carriers generated in one layer of the solar cell cannot be transported and collected on the other side of the

solar cell. Third, photoluminescence phenomenon has no direct relationship with solar cell operation. Fourth, solar cell performance is hindered by intermediate bandgap recombination. And finally, for practical applications, the material must have high thermal conductivity to transport heat from the device. But this is not the case for QDs.

Due to the above-mentioned fundamental drawbacks, the QD-based solar cells are and will remain a theoretical concept for research studies and never get to the manufacturing stage.
