## I Introduction

A development of installed power for new renewable energy sources (RES) together with increasing requirements for high quality of electric power generally requires modernization of grid infrastructure, which involves new transformers, grid nets, switching and compensation devices. On the other hand the same effect in comparison those standard solutions can be achieved by application energy storage systems (ESS) with its wide functionality [1-4]. Implementation of above installations are especially important to power system operators (PSO) as well as those sensitive consumers, bearing substantial power losses due to poor grid power quality. It is also crucial to industrial companies, which note a significant financial losses due to power quality aspects, voltage drops and other power supply disruptions and have no basic regulations to claim for a refund from PSO. According to above problems, power quality issues have become very important as much as decoupling from the effects of poor power quality.

As it is mentioned above, installing ESS together with RES installations provides numerous possibilities. Firstly it enables to store energy and operates as power reserve resource for balancing temporary demands and with higher energy capacity of an energy storage resources it can store energy and generate at high power demand during a day. Secondly it minimizes dynamic impact of RES on the power system, especially those with variable power capability generation, which require new grid investments. Finally improving power quality, which involves voltage drops, frequency changes, supply interruptions and reactive power compensation.

This paper presents a proposition of modular ESS, which block diagram is presented in fig. 1. It shows main elements of the system, required to create entire system. In addition to this scalability and flexible alternation of the system due to application of various topologies and utilization of different energy storage resources makes it a solution for future requirements.

Presented ESS can operate with low voltage (LV) or medium voltage (MV) grid, where in some applications a step down isolation transformer is required. The system consists of an input circuits, which includes switching and security elements, EMI and low pass filters. It is also fitted with input inductances, which are in front of a power block (PB). Each power block includes different types of power converters, where adequate topology can be selected in order to meet application requirements. Mainly it has a AC/DC grid converter, which converts energy from alternating current AC grid into a direct current circuits and a DC/DC converter responsible for output parameters regulation during charge and discharge process of

the ESR. In presented ESS a control system is divided into master-slave structure. Master controller based on measurements of grid parameters and on analysis of power quality aspects communicates with slave controllers in order to govern entire functionality of ESS. Additionally it can control selected parameters for regulation processes, selects tasks for each module to achieve functionality and communicates with external management systems. Slave controller next to a communication with a master controller, is in charge of controlling parameters of all power block converters with pulse width modulation PWM techniques.

## II Scalability of the system

In order to fulfil future requirements and have ability to fit into customer needs there are different possibilities which are described below. To achieve scalability of the entire system and to have higher power and capacity of stored energy we can adopt modular structure presented in fig. 2, the same as in fig. 1. Each module can operate independently which increases robustness of the entire system, allows independent energy management, implementation of different functions and operation with various energy storage resources.

An increase of stored electric energy capacity of ESS can be obtained by paralleling of DC/DC converters as it is presented in fig. 3. With this solution we have ability to connect large number of different energy storage resources to a common DC link of the system with minimum costs and without the need to design and build another ESS and its infrastructure. Another economic aspect is lower maintenance cost.

To get higher power of ESS it can be realized by parallel connections of AC/DC input converters, but in order to apply this topology each AC/DC converter must be supplied with isolated input (fig. 4). This solution brings positive as well economic and functional aspects, because most of the cost of the ESS is energy storage resource and addition of another AC/DC converter gives possibilities to implement another functions.

## III Power Converter Topologies

The main part of ESS is a power block, which is an interface between a grid and electric storage resource. A power block contains three phase AC/DC converter, responsible for energy conversion from AC to DC voltage system, and DC/DC converter controlling parameters of energy storage resource. A power block can be designed in two types, which are current source inverters (CSI) and voltage source inverter (VSI). Utilization of CSI and VSI structures depends on its application, operating environment, and its fundamental elements are semiconductor switches and energy storage elements. In most applications VSI converters are much more popular to CSI, therefore these topologies are presented in this article.

The first converter of a power block is a AC/DC converter, which is connected to a grid by input inductors (fig.1). A grid converter is operating as bidirectional converter, which allow to deliver electric energy into the energy storage resource (ESR) during a charging process and put back stored energy into a grid during discharging process. At the same time this converter stabilizes DC link voltage, ensures sinusoidal input current and performs additional functions connected with power quality.

A standard VSI topology for AC/DC is two level three phase converter, which is showed in fig. 5. In many applications requiring classical approach this topology can be applied to AC/DC and DC/DC converter, where the third leg of the converter connected to a resistor is used as protection circuit.

Depending on the grid voltage, in some applications an implementation of multilevel topologies is needed. It allow to operate with higher input voltages, reduce volume and costs of magnetic elements due to higher operating frequency in comparison to 2-level structures and reduces higher harmonics of input and output signals. In fig. 6 a 3-level NPC converter is presented.

A 3-level converter topology is also showed in fig. 7, which is based on reverse blocking RB-IGBT transistors and is called a T-type converter. Due to its benefits, which are lower number of elements in respect to NPC topology, higher robustness and lower costs, it has become very popular in a past few years.

A DC/DC converter is the next crucial element of the power block of ESS, which is responsible for regulating output parameters of a power block. Standard topologies of DC/DC bidirectional converter are showed in fig. 8. The first one is connected to a DC link of a power block and enables to connect one selected ESR. This topology can be connected in parallel, to operate with more ESRs or can be attached to a 3-level AC/DC as it was showed on the left in fig. 8. These configurations allow to connect desired number of ESRs, but nominal voltage is rather limited to a voltage of a DC link for each storage element. What is most important, this solution does not limit energy storage capacity of ESR. Application of aforementioned topologies which are presented in fig. 8a,b allow to operate as well as with inductive load, including e.g. superconducting magnetic energy storage SMES and capacitive one e.g. supercapacitors. The main difference is that capacitive loads require slight different circuit connection and additional an inductor with small inductance to limit output current ripples of potential supercapacitor.

Fig. 9 shows a topology of DC/DC converter for those applications where additional isolations is required. It also enables to adjust output voltage level in order to operate with various types of energy storage resources. This features are possible to implement by adding a dual active bridge (DAB) converter.

Fig. 10 shows a topology of DC/DC converters connected in parallel, which enables to connect various energy storage resources requiring different output parameters.

## IV Simulation of Selected Topologies

In order to design an ESS and to verify operation of the selected topologies, a simulation models were prepared in PSIM10.0 and its results are presented in the following figures.

Fig. 11 and 12 show operation of an interface of ESS, where power block is built with two main converters according to topology presented in fig. 5 and 8, where 2-level VSI converters are used. Fig. 11 and 12 present charging and discharging processes with \(\mathrm{I_{[z,m)}}=500\)A of output current, where electric energy is transferred to the ESR and back to a grid respectively at 250kW of rated power. To have an ability to present a current change during operation with SMES, an inductance of ESR \(L_{m}\) = 0.5 H was taken for simulation, otherwise this current would be almost constant for presented interval.

To investigate energy transfer between a power grid and ESR, phase grid current \(\mathrm{I_{i}}\), together with phase and phase to phase input voltage is presented. While taking energy from a grid, phase current and phase voltage is in phase, which means the ESS is taking pure active power with power factor close to unity. On the other hand, during discharging process, when an energy is transferred back to a power system, phase current and voltage is in opposition. In this situation an active energy is transferred to a power system.

Fig. 13 show similar operation in comparison to this showed in fig. 12, where a discharging process is analyzed, but for AC/DC converter a 3-level NPC topology is used, the same as in fig. 6. In fig. 13 a 3-level phase to phase voltage is showed against other signals. Application of this multilevel topology allow to decrease voltage and current harmonics as well as signal distortion, which also reflects in power quality parameters of the entire ESS.

In contrast to presented operation of interface of ESS with SMES, fig. 14 and 15 show operation with connected SES according to topology showed in fig.8a (on the bottom). To investigate charging and discharging processes, a selected signals were put together in the same way as with SMES operation. In order to achieve 250kW of rated power of the ESS, it can be noticed that in the worst case when a voltage of SES is decreasing reaching approximately 400V, a SES current is reaching 1kA. In this situation, it is important to take into consideration charging and discharging nominal current of SES. Otherwise output power of the entire ESS is limited to a nominal parameters of ESR.

## V 250 Kw Prototype Converter

According to simulation results a 250kW prototype of ESS was built and is showed in fig. 16a, b. To ensure scalability of the ESS and to have higher power and capacity of stored energy a structure presented in fig. 2 was adopted. The system is designed to operate with LV and to be supplied with 3x400 V, 50 - 60 Hz grid, but with additional isolation transformer it can be connected to MV grid. Technical parameters of the converter are gathered in table 1. The entire converter interface of ESS is designed in one separate cabinet, where a single module of ESS is fitted with input circuits, input inductors, power block, control and diagnostic system, according to block diagram showed in fig. 1. The construction of an interface of ESS and elements location are presented in fig. 16b.

The power block is built with Hitachi IGBT modules for 1200 V of blocking voltage and 1000A o nominal current. All the transistors are controlled with dedicated driver with fiber optic interface. Due to the power level and parameters of IGBT transistors, a power block is designed to operate up to 5kHz. Operation with higher frequency allow to reduce the size of magnetic elements and filter circuits. It also effects on the size of heatsink of the converter

The interface of ESS is designed to operate with forced air cooling system, where adequate heatsink is used for heat exchange. All control buttons and indication lamps together with diagnostic display are located in the front of the cabinet, which enables for controlling of an interface and is a user interface. It is also fitted with external interface e.g. CAN, RS485, PROFIBUS in order to connect all modules to the main, master controller or/and external management system.

Due to the fact that a presented prototype of ESS interface is under tests, a conducted research and results will be presented in separate paper. Additionally it would have extend the limits of this paper.
