## I Introduction

The Manufacturing technology of blue and green group-III nitride (III-N) LEDs is nowadays quite mature. The progress of III-N laser diodes (LDs) toward lasing at green wavelength is also rapid during the past two years. Demonstration of lasing at 500 nm under optical pumping (OP) of a structure grown on \(c\)-plane [1] was followed by publications on 500 nm electrically driven lasers [2]. The 531-nm LDs on semipolar plane [3] and a reliable continuous-wave (CW) LD with a wavelength of 515 nm on \(c\)-plane [4] have then been reported. Shortly afterward, a CW operation with emission wavelength up to 520 nm was achieved for \(c\)- [5] and semipolar plane [6] LDs. Such an encouraging progress in the empirical results motivates the study of physical properties of III-N materials and heterostructures in order to engineer epitaxial structure and further optimize the laser performance. A number of publications presented further improvements [7, 8], including the structural quality of the active region [9, 10] and new waveguide design solutions [11]. Another important aspect however, is the understanding of the carrier injection mechanism into the active region.

The wurtzite crystal III-N compounds have specific optical, electronic, and structural properties, which is different from other III/V compounds. Because of this, traditional physical analysis approaches used for other semiconductor compounds, are often not applicable to III-N system or need to be revised.

Important peculiarity of III-N system is large heterojunction band offsets and strong spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization fields (up to several megavolts per centimeter) [12] due to the heterojunction charges caused by the lattice-mismatch strain and crystal asymmetry along \(c\)-axis. They strongly affect the charge carrier transport, which is the key phenomenon responsible for the optoelectronic device operation. In the quantum wells (QWs), they cause electron and hole wavefunction displacement and the reduction of electron-hole optical transition energy known as the quantum-confined Stark effect (QCSE) [13, 14]. These polarization fields are the highest if the structure is formed with \(c\)-plane crystal orientation, are much lower when one uses a semipolar (tilted from \(c\)-plane) orientation, and do not exist in the nonpolar orientation, which is 90 degree off of the \(c\)-plane [12].

Mechanisms of carrier injection and capture into multiple QW (MQW) active region and its influence on the LD operation have been a subject of extensive theoretical and experimental study for various III-V compounds [15] including group-III nitride LDs emitting in violet-blue spectral range [16, 17]. In general, the carrier dynamics in the semiconductor heterostructure system is a quite complex statistical process that can be formalized using Boltzmann equations, electron, and hole wavefunctions and self-consisted solution of Schrodinger and Poisson equations. The most rigorous approach for simulation is a Monte Carlo method [18] that requires extensive computational resources. To reduce the computational resources, it is often necessary to employ semianalytical approximations. However, each particular approximation is only applicable to particular structures determined by layer thickness, carrier effective masses, doping levels, electric fields, and heterojunction properties. The particular physical phenomena (such as transport and recombination mechanisms) that dominate in the system and models appropriate for explaining and predicting structure behavior vary with not only the material system, but also alloy compositions, i.e., lasing emission wavelength. In recent publications [19, 20, 21], it is suggested that because the carrier ballistic transport is comparable or faster than the relaxation and the recombination processes, no common Fermi-Dirac distribution exists between the barrier states and the QW statesin InGaN/GaN the MQWs with deep carrier localization. This challenges the development of new approaches addressing the carrier transport across MQWs, carrier capture to the QW, and carrier recombination in the QW in such a system.

The development and validation of physical models requires experimental data. A large body of experimental results is available for blue and green LEDs grown with \(c\)-plane structure crystal orientation. The experimental data for blue and green LDs, especially those grown on the nonpolar and semipolar planes, is limited, because such devices became available just recently. In this paper, we address the carrier transport in \(c\)-, nonpolar, and semipolar plane LDs experimentally and theoretically. Nevertheless, the conclusions of our study may be used for LED carrier transport phenomena. To make the problem computationally manageable, we make certain approximations, as discussed in detail below. This allows us to achieve a reasonable accuracy within material parameter uncertainty and leads to the generalized conclusions. In Section II, we describe our LD structures and experimental procedures. In Section III, we discuss lasing characteristics as a function of the number of the QWs for \(c\)- and semipolar LD structure that are affected by carrier transport across the MQWs. The carrier transport analysis is presented in Section IV, and in Section V, we discuss how carrier injection nonuniformity among the QWs affects net optical gain and the LD performance. The last section summarizes the conclusions.

## II LDs and Experimental Procedure

The structures studied in this work were grown by metal-organic vapor-phase epitaxy (MOVPE) method on free-standing GaN substrates with \(c\)- or semipolar-plane orientations. The structures comprised AlGaN cladding layers, InGaN waveguiding layers, and 2.5-nm-thick InGaN QWs. The QW number varied between 2 and 5. Indium concentration in \(c\)-plane LD QWs was approximately 22%, and in semipolar LDs, it was estimated to be about 30%. The barrier width between QWs was approximately equal (\(\sim\)10 nm) for \(c\)-plane and semipolar structures. The LDs were processed into a ridge-waveguide or broad-area geometry.

The lasing was studied under electrical pumping (EP) in pulsed and CW modes. Under pulsed EP, the pulse duration was 100 ns and the duty cycle was 5 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-4}\). Fig. 1 shows as an example light-current (LI) curves and lasing spectrum of our ridge waveguide green laser device with an emission wavelength of 521 nm grown on the semipolar substrate. Under CW operation, the threshold current is higher than under pulsed operation. Also, the CW LI characteristic rolls over at current above 170 mA. We attribute this to a heating of the chip taking place during CW operation.

The comparison of LD performance under EP and OP was used in this study to isolate the effect of carrier transport on the laser threshold current. For OP, we used an optical parametric oscillator laser operating at a wavelength of 415 nm, a duty cycle of 10\({}^{-7}\), and a pulse duration of 5 ns. At this wavelength, the pump light is absorbed directly into the QWs. Since each QW absorbs only 3% of pump beam focused from the top as a stripe, we achieved nearly equal pump power density for several QWs in the MQW structure. The carriers were generated and confined in the QWs and could not escape from the QW because of the deep confinement. As a result, there was no carrier transport during OP, and so, the pumping efficiency of each QW was independent of the structure features.

For accurate comparison between the EP and the OP lasing performance, broad area LDs were used. Due to low duty cycle and short pulse duration during both OP and EP measurements, we avoided the heating the structure. For each laser bar, the EP device characteristics were first measured. Then, the metallization was stripped by acidic solutions and the laser bars were optically pumped with a 100-\(\mu\)m-wide stripe in order to measure lasing threshold and wavelength under OP. This comparison allowed us to distinguish carrier transport phenomena. While carrier transport has no impact on the lasing characteristics under the OP, it is expected to have strong impact under the EP.

The same OP conditions were used to measure the optical gain of the QWs by the varied stripe length (VSL) method. For the gain measurement [22], we used a piece of wafer with one cleaved edge from which the emission was collected. We used MQW LD structures for this measurement. Again, due to uniform pumping under OP, this allowed us to obtain modal gain from an individual QW by dividing the total modal gain by the number of QWs.

In the following section, we present the experimental data of the LD structures where the number of QWs was varied. Except for the different number of QWs, there were no other differences in the LD design.

## III MQW LDs Under Optical and Electrical Pumping

Fig. 2 presents the threshold current density for LD series where the layer structure design was not changed but the number of QWs was varied. Fig. 2(a) shows that both the OP absorbed threshold pumping power density \(P_{\rm th}\) and the EP threshold current density \(J_{\rm th}\) are weakly dependent on the number of QWs for green LDs grown on semipolar substrates. For aquamarine LD grown on \(c\)-plane, the \(P_{\rm th}\) for OP is weakly dependent on the number of the QWs. This behavior is expected because under OP all QWs are evenly pumped, and therefore, every QW contributes to the optical gain. On the other hand, the threshold current density \(J_{\rm th}\) for EP dramatically increases with the number of QWs. This unexpected behavior is rather different

not only from the semipolar green LDs whose result is shown in Fig. 2(a), but also from \(c\)-plane violet QW LDs where up to ten QWs could be used [23]. This result points to a significant carrier transport effect in \(c\)-plane LDs emitting at longer wavelengths, which is not pronounced for shorter wavelength light emitters and for semipolar substrates. Furthermore, the lasing wavelengths under OP and EP are plotted in Fig. 3. The lasing wavelength is nearly the same in the case of OP and EP semipolar green LDs, while for \(c\)-plane aquamarine LD under EP it is longer (by \(\approx\)10 nm) than under OP, when the number of QWs is greater than 2. To understand this difference and make the general conclusions about the carrier injection in LDs designed for different wavelengths and grown on different substrate orientations, in the following sections we analyze carrier transport in the MQWs and measured QW optical gain spectra.

## IV Carrier Transport Analysis

### _Overview of Simulation Approaches_

There are several conventional approximations that can be derived from the Boltzmann equation, each applicable under certain conditions.

The drift-diffusion model [16, 17, 24, 25] calculates carrier concentration and current density as a function of spatial coordinate with the assumption of Fermi-Dirac quasi-equilibrium energy distribution separately for electrons and holes. The electric field is in turn self-consistently calculated from charge carrier concentration distribution via Poisson equation. This local quasi-equilibrium is realized when the following two conditions are satisfied: \(\nabla n/n\ll l^{-1}\) and \(e\Sigma/kT\ll l^{-1}\), where \(l\) is the mean free path, \(e\) is the electron charge, and \(\Sigma\) is electric field in a layer. The quasi-equilibrium may, however, remain even when these conditions do not hold; for example, it was successfully used for MQW heterostructure when the band offsets are relatively small [17]. Therefore, the drift-diffusion model is applicable for relatively thick semiconductor layers (in the bulk) and/or layers with relatively low electric fields and band offsets at the heterointerfaces.

In the case of abrupt heterointerfaces or even for a layer with steep electronic potential gradient (strong electric field) the thermionic model can be used [16, 24]. In contrast to the drift-diffusion model, the thermionic model deals with the transport region size that is less than the mean free path, such that the carrier ballistic transport occurs across the considered layer or interface. The thermionic model assumes the Fermi-Dirac carrier distribution on each side of this ballistic region and hence describes carrier transport by analytical formula that depends on just the carrier temperature, concentration and the band profile. The thermionic model can, however, be combined with the drift-diffusion model where it is used as a boundary condition between adjacent drift-diffusion regions [16, 24].

Both the drift-diffusion and the thermionic models consider carrier wavefunction in the quasi-classical approximation. Tunneling through a barrier is a quantum-mechanical process that can be rigorously simulated using the multiband quantum-transmitting boundary method [27]. The simplified WKB approximation [28] allows integrating tunneling with the quasi-classical approximation in the drift-diffusion and the thermionic models [26].

In this paper, we focus on 1-D modeling of carrier dynamics in order to address the carrier injection via emission and tunneling processes along the direction perpendicular to the structure plane. The carrier motion is treated in the quasi-classical approximation. The carrier energy is counted from the bottom of the conduction band for electrons and the top of the valence bands for holes. The total kinetic energy of each carrier consists of the lateral component \(E^{||}=p_{z}^{2}/(2m_{0}m^{*x})+p_{y}^{2}/(2m_{0}m^{*y})\) and the vertical component \(E^{\perp}=p_{z}^{2}/(2m_{0}m^{*\perp})\), where \(m_{0}\) is electron mass, \(x\), \(y\) are the lateral directions with corresponding effective masses \(m^{*x,y}\), the average lateral effective mass is \((m^{*||})^{2}=m^{*x}m^{*y}\). The direction \(z\) is perpendicular to the structure plane, \(m^{\perp}\) is the effective mass in this direction. We limit theoretical formulation here to the \(c\)-plane and nonpolar plane crystal orientations, where the carrier transport occurs along the polar or nonpolar axis, respectively. However, one can develop a semipolar orientation approximation by bringing the effective mass tensor to the crystal plane coordinates via rotation tensor, which, however, may require special derivation of density of states and tunneling rates. Since we split the carrier energy to parallel and normal components, we can treat separately the 2-D lateral density of states (corresponding to quantization of in-plane \(k\)-vector) per unit energy and unit area \(N^{||}(E^{||})=m_{0}m_{e,h}^{||}/\pi\hbar^{2}\), and the 1-D density of states in \(z\)-direction per unit length and unit energy.

Fig. 2: Threshold as a function of the number of QWs for LDs grown on (a) semipolar and (b) \(c\)-plane substrates.

The 1-D density of the states may be calculated per unit energy and unit length using quasi-continuous approximation [29]\(N^{\perp}(E^{\perp})=\left(2m_{0}m_{e,h}^{\perp}E^{\perp}/\hbar^{2}\right)^{-1/2}/\pi\) or by solving the 1-D Schrodinger equation in the active region domain. The statistical carrier population distribution in the states is then considered. This approach, being an approximation of the quantum-mechanical density matrix approach, provides a sufficiently high accuracy in simulating carrier transport phenomena in this system. At the same time, for the QW-confined states, the consideration of recombination processes requires rigorous calculations of quantization effects. We consider carrier recombination and concentration in order to estimate threshold condition of LD, but exact calculation of optical gain (being rather complicated to calculate accurately for different QW plane orientations [30, 31]) is out of the scope of this paper. Instead, we address the optical gain using experimental data discussed in Section V. We adopt the local carrier capture/escape approach [32, 33] to simulate carrier coupling between the free motion carrier spectrum and QW-confined states.

For the simulation of the passive regions, we adopt the traditional coupled drift-diffusion and recombination models [17], while for the MQW active region we develop a new approach.

### _Carrier Capture and Escape_

The processes of carrier capture into the QW-confined states and the escape from the QW states involves phonon-assisted relaxation and activation [27, 28, 29]. In our consideration, the carrier capture into QW is only possible in the collection region \(D\) (or in the tunneling length proximity of _D_). We define here that \(D\) is the region of the barrier and QW at which \(E^{\perp}>E_{C,V}\) because only in this region the carrier can relax to a state with lower \(E^{\perp}\). If, however, for any adjacent barriers \(E^{\perp}>E_{\rm bp}\), where \(E_{\rm bp}\) is the energy at the barrier summit, region \(D\) corresponds to the QW, because only there the capture may occur. The carrier relaxation time \(\tau_{rl}\) from the electronic spectrum corresponding to the delocalized states to QW levels [34] is known to be approximately 200 fs, which is close to the carrier LO-phonon scattering time [35, 36]. This means that the capture is not strongly affected by resonance effects [37] in this system, likely because of averaging over several states involved in this process.

In general, the carrier thermal activation flux energy distribution is interrelated with the relaxation time due to detailed balance principle [38], and it is an exponential function of the activation energy

\[j_{\rm act}\left(E_{\rm act}^{\perp}\right)=\frac{N^{D}}{\tau_{rl}}n_{\rm QW} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E_{\rm act}^{\perp}}{k_{B}T}\right) \tag{1}\]

where \(N^{D}=\int_{D}N^{\perp}dz\) is the total density of states over collection region \(D\) in z-direction to which the escape occurs. The energy \(E_{\rm act}^{\perp}=E_{G}^{\perp}+\Delta E_{\rm act}^{\perp}\) corresponds to the state to which the carrier is activated while \(E_{G}^{\perp}\) is the energy from which the activation mostly occurs, i.e., it is the lowest QW ground state above Fermi level. The escape process of carriers from a QW is schematically shown in Fig. 4(a) presenting the general case when the polarization field in the crystal layers can create triangular spikes in the barrier band profile. It was shown theoretically and experimentally [39, 40], that for typical barrier thickness (\(\sim\)10 nm or more) the carrier escape from QW at positive-bias voltage is only possible via thermal emission or thermal-activation-assisted tunneling. The carriers can be activated to energy \(E_{\rm act}^{\perp}\), sufficient to tunnel through the barrier spike or fly above it. The activated carrier can either escape away from the active region or relax back to the QW states. The probability for a carrier with energy \(E_{\rm act}^{\perp}\) to escape is \(\tau_{rl}/(\tau_{rl}+\Lambda(E_{\rm act}^{\perp}))\), where \(A\) is the time of carrier transit away from the collection region [see (3) and (4)]. The value of \(A\) can be much longer than \(\tau_{rl}\) if \(E_{\rm act}^{\perp}\) is below the barrier top energy \(E_{\rm bp}\) when the tunneling transmission probability is much less than unity. The average carrier escape time from the QW localized state defined this way can thus be calculated by integrating activation flux from (1) multiplied by the escape probability and dividing it by \(n_{\rm QW}\)

\[\tau_{\rm esc}^{-1}=\int_{0}^{\infty}\left(\tau_{rl}+A\right)^{-1}N^{D}\,\exp \left(-\frac{\Delta E_{\rm act}^{\perp}}{k_{B}T}\right)dE_{\rm act}^{\perp}. \tag{2}\]

Fig. 4(b) presents the average escape time of electrons and holes for an InGaN/GaN QW, plotted versus QW emission wavelength. With increase of emission wavelength, the carrier

confinement in the QW is deeper because the band offset between QW and barrier increases and for _c_-plane QW the barrier spike increases too. The value of \(\tau_{\mathrm{esc}}\) increases for deeper confinement because on average the carriers need to reach higher activation energy, which exponentially slows down the escape. We can see that for the light emitters designed for wavelength \(<\)450 nm, the \(\tau_{\mathrm{esc}}\) may be shorter than the recombination time \(\tau_{\mathrm{rec}}\) that for LD is approximately 1 ns in spontaneous operation regime near the threshold, but it becomes much shorter in the lasing regime. For 400 nm device, for both electrons and holes \(\tau_{\mathrm{esc}}\leq\tau_{\mathrm{rec}}\) that means that both electrons and holes can escape with high probability before recombining, move toward another QW and get recaptured by it. For the light emitters with wavelength longer than 450 nm, it is not the case and the condition \(\tau_{\mathrm{esc}}>\tau_{\mathrm{rec}}\) means that a carrier once captured by a QW will most likely recombine in it before being able to escape. In this situation, the carrier population among QWs in the MQW structure is determined by carrier transit rate from one QW to another and carrier capture rate into a QW. This also means that there is no common quasi-equilibrium among QWs, neither there is a common quasi-equilibrium between carriers localized in the QW and carriers delocalized and transferring across the barriers. It is worth noting, that our calculations show that in aquamarine-green LD structures studied here, the carrier escape is negligibly slow also under OP, when no electric bias is applied, in agreement with [39] and [40].

The carrier capture/escape processes in group-III nitride QWs are strongly influenced by the electric fields in the barriers. The high electric field in the barrier can increase capture-collection region. The tunneling effect not only reduces escape barrier, but also slows down delocalized carrier transit rate. Due to smaller band offsets in valence band than in conduction band, the thermally activated escape rate for holes is faster than for electrons. However, as we can see in Fig. 4(b), even for holes, it is still much slower than the recombination rate. Holes have slower average tunneling rate and free motion velocity. In addition, relaxation rates are higher for holes than for electrons [35, 36, 41, 42]. Therefore, the hole-capture probability is much higher than that for electrons. As we will see below, this plays a key role in the carrier distribution among QWs in the case of a high electric field in the barrier, when carrier motion in the _z_-direction is overall slowed down. In this case, the carrier distribution is controlled by the hole-capture process.

Due to the slow carrier escape rate, the drift-diffusion approximation (which was successfully used for violet and blue light emitters) would not work for aquamarine-green LDs and LEDs. Also, because of incomplete carrier capture into the QWs, the carrier concentration in the barrier regions is higher than it would be in case of the common quasi-equilibrium. Due to strong polarization fields in the barriers of _c_-plane MQWs, there is no local quasi-equilibrium in every point of the barrier, so the condition necessary for drift-diffusion current is not satisfied. In fact, based on experimental data for carrier mobility in intrinsic material [41, 42], the mean free path of electrons is 30-100 nm and for holes it is 10-30 nm (depending on the kinetic velocity), which is longer or comparable with typical barrier width \(\sim\)10 nm, and on this length scale, the band potential in one barrier can change by several \(k_{B}\,T\). Note that this hole mean free path is still much longer than that in Mg-doped material where the mobility is strongly reduced by the impurity scattering due to the high concentration of Mg.

### _Ballistic Transport_

We suggest considering the ballistic fly over and tunneling processes across whole QW plus barrier region. This approach can be used for nonpolar, semipolar, or polar MQW systems; therefore, the carrier transport may be compared between them. We use a rate-equation model schematically depicted in Fig. 5, and calculate for each \(i\)th QW 2-D concentrations of electrons \(n^{i}_{\mathrm{QW}}\) and holes \(p^{i}_{\mathrm{QW}}\) in confined states, and local 3-D concentrations of delocalized carriers \(n^{i}_{\mathrm{bar}}\), \(p^{i}_{\mathrm{bar}}\) with energy high enough to have significant transport across the barriers as well as from/into the passive region. We are interested in the delocalized carriers at each QW region because only these carriers can be captured into the QWs confined states. The carriers confined and delocalized in each QW have separate statistical distribution in the _k_-space.

Let us first consider the transit mechanism of an individual delocalized carrier from one QW to another. The transit from a passive region to the adjacent QW and from one QW to another occurs via ballistic fly over if \(E^{\perp}>E_{\mathrm{b}p}\). The transmission

Fig. 5: Schematic of carrier transport and capture to the QWs in a structure with (a) low and (b) high polarization fields.

probability \(t\) for carriers travelling across the barrier is \(\sim\)1 in this case. If \(E^{\perp}<E_{\rm bp}\), then the transport mechanism is tunneling and \(t\) reduces rapidly with reducing \(E^{\perp}\). For triangular barrier shape, which takes place for \(c\)-plane structures, the following analytical formula for \(t\) can be derived from Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation [26, 28, 43] by integrating in \(z\)-direction along the region of imaginary \(k\)-vector

\[t(E^{\perp})\approx\exp\left(-\frac{4\sqrt{2m_{0}m_{e,h}^{*\perp}}}{3e\cdot \hbar}\cdot\frac{\left(E_{\rm bp}-E^{\perp}\right)^{3/2}}{|\Sigma|}\right) \tag{3}\]

where \(\Sigma\) is the electric field in the barrier, \(m_{0}\) is the free electron mass, while \(m_{e,h}^{*\perp}\) is electron and hole effective masses, respectively, in the \(z\)-direction. In case, when \(t\) is close to unity, (3) underestimates \(t\) by \(\sim\)30%, which is, however, still sufficiently accurate for present model because this systematic error exists for any reasonable electric field in the barrier. For future accuracy improvement, one can calculate adjustment coefficient function.

The transit time of electrons or holes, across the collection region is

\[{\rm A}_{e,h}=\frac{1}{t}\int_{D}v_{e,h}^{-1}dx \tag{4}\]

where the ballistic velocity

\[v_{e,h}=\sqrt{2(E^{\perp}-E_{C,V})/(m_{0}m_{e,h}^{*\perp})} \tag{5}\]

is a function of the coordinate due to the gradient of conduction band or valence band energy \(E_{C,V}\), respectively. \(m_{e,h}^{*\perp}\) is the effective mass of electrons or holes in the carrier propagation direction. If \(E^{\perp}>E_{\rm bp}\), then carriers fly over the barrier and the transmission probability \(t\) is \(\sim\)1. If \(E^{\perp}<E_{\rm bp}\), then the tunneling mechanism is involved, which reduces \(t\) in accordance with formula (3), and so may strongly increase the transit time. This transit probability and time are important to analyze carrier capture probability to QW and calculate carrier transit flux.

The carriers injected from active region have the Fermi-Dirac distribution. For each \(E^{\perp}\), the effective 2-D density of states (per unit area) is then given by

\[N_{C,V}^{2D}=\frac{m_{0}m_{e,h}^{||}}{\pi\hbar^{2}}k_{B}T. \tag{6}\]

From (3) and (5), the total current flux is calculated by integrating the carrier flux over all \(E^{\perp}\)

\[J =e\int_{\rm CTL}^{\infty}j(E^{\perp})dE^{\perp}\] \[j(E^{\perp}) =N_{C,V}^{2D}f(E^{\perp})t(E^{\perp})N^{\perp}(E^{\perp})v_{e,h}( E^{\perp}) \tag{7}\]

where \(f(E^{\perp})\) is the carrier population for zero \(E^{||}\).

### _Low Polarization Field_

Let us now focus on an extreme case when the polarization field is low, i.e., when the barrier shapes are close to rectangular, as shown in Fig. 5(a). This situation is realized for the nonpolar or semipolar MQW system. In this case, the tunneling contribution is negligible, and most of the transport occurs via the free ballistic fly over of carriers having \(E^{\perp}>E_{\rm bp}\).

Also, in this case, the energy spacing between all the states in the \(z\)-direction is less than \(k_{B}T\) in the energy range corresponding to the carrier transit, so we can treat the electron and hole spectra as quasi-continuous. The average carrier flux from an \(t\)th QW to the left and right-hand sides may be calculated assuming Fermi-Dirac distribution. Most of carriers travelling across the barrier have the energy close to \(E_{\rm bp}\) (only \(\sim\)\(k_{B}T\) above it), and therefore, we can state that the transport across the barriers occurs at around carrier transport level (CTL) which in the case of a low polarization field coincides with \(E_{\rm bp}\). Each QW has two CTLs of the two adjacent barriers. Suppose that CTL of one barrier (here on the left side) is lower than that of another barrier.

To simplify the notation, we first consider the transport of the electrons. The electron current flux from a QW via the lowest CTL can be derived from (7) using Bolzmann's carrier distribution over \(E^{\perp}\) as follows (here it is from \(i\)th to (\(i\)-1)th QW)

\[J^{i\to i-1}=\frac{n_{\rm bar}^{i}}{N_{C}(E_{\rm LCTL})}J^{*} \tag{8}\]

where \(N_{C}(E_{\rm LCTL})=k_{B}T\cdot N_{C}^{\perp}(E_{\rm LCTL})N_{C}^{2D}\) is the effective density of states for electrons with energy \(E_{\rm LCTL}\) corresponding to this lowest CTL, and here, \(J^{*}=J^{*T\bar{I}}\), where

\[J^{*T\bar{I}}=\frac{2e(k_{B}T)^{2}m_{0}m_{\rm bar}^{*||}\eta}{\pi^{2}\hbar^{3}} \tag{9}\]

is the maximal ballistic flux through this barrier. If another CTL has a higher energy (here it is on the right-hand side), the carrier population at these energy levels exponentially decreases with energy difference between CTLs \(\Delta E_{\rm bar}\), and therefore, the carrier current flux through another CTL can be expressed as

\[J^{i\to i+1}=J^{*}\frac{n_{\rm bar}^{i}}{N_{C}(E_{\rm LCTL})}\exp\left(- \frac{\Delta E_{\rm bar}^{i}}{k_{B}T}\right). \tag{10}\]

When the right CTL appears to be lower than left CTL, the right-hand sides of expressions (8) and (10) are swapped. The expressions (5)-(7) are analogous to that for the ballistic transport model developed by Grupen and Hess [44], in which they employed the thermionic model [24, 25, 26, 17] to calculate carrier flux via delocalized states across the QW. However, here we consider carrier transit of delocalized carriers through both a QW and adjacent barrier. Also, in this study, we consider separately the energy components attributed to lateral and normal momenta. This approach is, in general, more physically accurate for group-III nitride MQW system because it allows simulation of the carrier transport across the barrier that is thinner than carrier mean free path and comparison of the carrier transport between the structures with low and high polarization fields, as we will see in the following sections. Analogous formulation can be used for the valence band to address hole transport. In order to take into account multiple valence bands, one can use anisotropic effective valence band mass approximation formulated for example in [26]. Due to heavier average effective mass of holes, the hole transport is, overall, slower.

### _High Polarization Field_

Let us now consider another case when polarization fields are high (\(>\)0.3 MV/cm), as it is schematically depicted in Fig. 5(b). In this case, the barrier spike is so high that carriers injected from the passive region have too small of a population at \(E^{\perp}>E_{\mathrm{bp}}\) and the tunneling current flux at energy \(E^{\perp}<E_{\mathrm{bp}}\) dominates, besides the fact that \(t<1\). Fig. 6(a) presents the plot of \(f(E^{\perp})\), \(t(E^{\perp})\), and resultant flux energy distribution \(j(E^{\perp})\) for carrier temperature 300 K calculated with an assumption of the quasi-continuous spectrum of \(E^{\perp}\). We can see that there is a peak of carrier flux function versus energy, and therefore, most of the carrier transport occurs with energies around this peak. In the case of triangular barrier shape (which takes place for undoped barrier) and Boltzmann carrier distribution, the carrier flux can be approximately calculated to be a function of the \(j(E^{\perp})\) peak position that we call \(E_{\mathrm{CTL}}^{\mathrm{tun}}\) and the peak width \(\Phi\). In quasi-continuous approximation for \(N^{\perp}\), the \(j(E^{\perp})\) peak position obeys the analytical expression by finding the zero of function derivative:

\[E_{\mathrm{CTL}}^{\mathrm{tun}}=E_{\mathrm{bp}}-\frac{1}{8m_{0}m_{\mathrm{ bar}}^{\star\perp}}\left(\frac{\Sigma\hbar e}{k_{B}T}\right)^{2}. \tag{11}\]

We can now assign the \(j(E^{\perp})\) peak position as the CTL, and in terms of rate equation, calculate the ballistic current flux around this CTL using (8) and (10), while the tunneling maximal flux shall be \(J^{*}=J^{\mathrm{tun}}\), which is formulated as follows:

\[J^{\mathrm{tun}} =\frac{2ek_{B}Tm_{0}m_{\mathrm{bar}}^{\star\parallel}}{\pi^{2} \hbar^{3}}\int_{-\infty}^{E_{\mathrm{bp}}}\exp{\left(-\frac{E^{\perp}}{k_{B}T} \right)}t(E^{\perp})dE^{\perp}\] \[\approx\frac{2ek_{B}Tm_{0}m_{\mathrm{bar}}^{\star\parallel}}{\pi ^{2}\hbar^{3}}t(E_{\mathrm{CTL}})\cdot\Phi \tag{12}\]

where \(t\) is calculated via (3). Formula (12) can be therefore calculated analytically except for \(\Phi\). Although \(\Phi\) cannot be derived analytically, if counted in units of [\(k_{B}T\)] it may be precalculated as a unique function of the barrier electric field counted in units of \(\left[\sqrt{m_{0}m_{\mathrm{bar}}^{\star\perp}}/e\hbar\right]\).

In case, if the energy spacing between the states in \(z\)-direction is comparable or larger than \(k_{B}T\), the CTL may appear to be between two states, such that the carrier transport will actually occur away from it. However, according to our Schrodinger equation calculations, this displacement is typically less than \(\Phi\), such that the error due to quasi-continuous assumption will be within overall accuracy of this model. We should also keep in mind that these expressions are only valid if the carrier distribution obeys exponential decay with both lateral and vertical energy components. Due to relatively long time of residence in the barrier area (caused by low \(t\)), the thermalization is likely for the carriers that are delocalized in the barriers. The carrier temperature, however, may be higher than the crystal temperature [21]. The analysis of carrier heating is out of the scope of this paper, and for simplicity, we will assume carrier temperature to be equal to the crystal temperature.

In the case of the holes, (12) represents the flux via transport in one of three valence bands. Depending on crystal orientation, one of the valence bands has the lowest \(m_{h}^{\star\perp}\) making the tunneling the most intense via this band. For \(c\)-plane orientation, the lowest \(m_{h}^{\star\perp}\) corresponds to the split-off band. One should keep in mind that although the tunneling dominates via one band, the density of states is summed over of all three bands. In other words, for a given local carrier concentration, only a fraction of them (populating the band with lowest \(m_{h}^{\star\perp}\)) participate in the transit process, while all carriers participate in the capture process.

In intermediate case, when tunneling and thermoactivated emission transport processes are comparable, in (8) and (10) the maximal flux is the sum of thermal-emission and tunneling components \(J^{*}=J^{\mathrm{\tau}Tl}+J^{\mathrm{\tau}\mathrm{tun}}\).

### _Capture Probability During Ballistic Transport_

In order to calculate capture rate of delocalized carriers to QW-confined states, we use the concept of capture coefficient. Each carrier, while residing in the collection region (the region around the QW, determined by the band diagram, in which the carrier may relax to the energy below the lowest adjacent CTL), has a probability to relax below a CTL (i.e., be captured) or may proceed to the adjacent QW. Therefore, the probability of such a carrier to be captured is the ratio between the carrier transit time and carrier relaxation time

\[C=\left\langle\mathrm{A}_{c,h}\right\rangle\tau_{rl}^{-1}. \tag{13}\]

Fig. 6: (a) Tunneling across a triangular barrier taking into account carrier statistics. (b) Averaged transit time in comparison with the relaxation time.

The relaxation time \(\tau_{r,l}\) depends on the fundamental rate of carrier scattering by LO phonon, and therefore, if \(\tau_{r,l}\) is averaged over the states involved in relaxation, we consider it to be weakly dependent on the structure design, carrier density, and applied bias. The transit time, however, is a strong function of the electric field in the barrier, i.e., it is defined by the band diagram. The carriers with energy below the lowest CTL are considered to be captured because they can no longer travel across any barrier (or their probability of transport via the tunneling is much lower than of further relaxation) and can either get reactivated (which is relatively unlikely) or further continue relaxing toward the QW ground state. Thus, we can formulate that within our formalism the capture rate to an \(i\)th QW is the following:

\[J^{i}_{\rm cap}=C(J^{*}+J^{\rm\,{tun}}). \tag{14}\]

Let us now consider typical \(\langle A_{e,h}\rangle\) values for QWs with barrier \(\sim\)10 nm in comparison with \(\tau^{C}_{e,h}\). In the case of low electric field in the barriers, when thermal-emission current across the barrier dominates, the transit time calculated using (4) is \(\sim\)100 fs for holes and \(\sim\)30 fs for electrons. The hole transit time is longer due to the fact that only one valence band has small \(m^{*,\!+}_{h}\), and therefore, the average kinetic energy is lower. The LO phonon-assisted carrier relaxation time is estimated to be \(\sim\)200 fs [36]; thus, for the low electric field in the barrier, both electrons and holes have high probability to proceed across the QW period, and therefore, get distributed relatively evenly among several QWs.

In the case of increased electric field, \(\langle A_{e,h}\rangle\) increases because average \(t\) reduces. This average residence time (weighted to the flux energy distribution) can be precalculated as a unique function (in the same way as \(\Phi\)) and used in the simulations. Fig. 6(b) presents the carrier transit time as a function of electric field in the barrier calculated for \(c\)-plane structure at room temperature. We can see that at high electric field, because the transport occurs mainly via the tunneling, the transit time becomes much slower. It may become even slower than the capture time, which basically means that most of the carriers injected in a QW collection region will be trapped by this QW rather than proceed toward the next QW. This should cause strong asymmetry in the carrier population among QWs.

The continuity equation links the transit, capture, and escape fluxes

\[J^{i-1\to i}+J^{i+1\to i}+J^{i}_{\rm act}=J^{i\to i+1}+J^{i\to i-1}+J^{i}_{\rm cap} \tag{15}\]

where the activation fluxes for electrons and holes are \(J^{i}_{\rm act,n}=j_{\rm act}(E_{\rm LCTL})k_{B}T\). In order to calculate the population and recombination of the QW-confined carriers in the spontaneous recombination regime (i.e., below threshold), we can use conventional rate equations for recombination in the QWs [15, 16, 17, 45]

\[J^{i}_{\rm cap(e,h)}=d\cdot\beta\cdot n_{\rm QW}\cdot p_{\rm QW}\cdot B+J_{\rm nr} \tag{16}\]

where \(d\) is the QW width and \(\beta\) is the overlap integral (which may be \(<\!\!<\)1 due to QCSE in \(c\)-plane LDs [13, 14] as calculated with quantum-mechanical simulation in [16] and [17]). The nonradiative recombination rate \(J_{\rm nr}\) can be calculated using the theory of Shockley-Read recombination and Auger recombination [45].

The steady-state rate equations described above allow us to simulate the structure behavior below lasing threshold and analyze LD threshold currents. In general, using this carrier-transport model, the simulation may also be performed in the stimulated emission regime, which requires adding stimulated emission and photoexcitation terms in (15) and coupling these rate equations with the rate equation for photon population [15, 44].

### _Band Diagram Simulation_

Equations (8), (9), and (14)-(16) make a set of rate equations for the local carrier concentrations at each QW that are solved self-consistently with the Poisson equation, taking into account heterojunction charges and the carrier concentration in the QW-confined states. This determines the band diagram and the positions of \(E_{\rm bp}\), CTLs, barriers shapes, transmission coefficients, and transit times used in (3), (4), and (11). Due to relatively low delocalized carrier concentration in the barriers, here we neglect their contribution to the band diagram, and also, neglect the delocalized carriers recombination, although in some structure designs it may need to be taken into account. We, however, consider the transport and recombination of the minority carriers in the passive regions (including current blocking layers) because the total concentration of such carriers is significant. The carrier transport in the passive region can be treated with the conventional drift diffusion model [17, 24, 25]. At the boundary between the MQW and passive region, we use the thermionic transport model. Because the ballistic maximal flux from (9) used in MQW is the same as in conventional thermionic model, we can couple the carrier transport in passive region with that in MQWs. The components \(J^{i-1\to i}\), \(J^{i\to i-1}\), and \(J^{i\to i+1}\), \(J^{i+1\to i}\) for the first and last QWs, respectively, are the thermionic fluxes from and into the passive regions.

The simulation can be performed numerically in two steps. In the first step, some of the functions are precalculated, as was described above. In the second step, using analytical rate equations, expressions and precalculated functions for MQW coupled with the analytical expressions for modeling the passive region, the band diagram, currents, and recombination rates can be computed. This algorithm is very attractive since it allows better control over solution convergence and reduces the computation time.

Although the polarization fields in the QWs and the barriers may be very high, in the diode operation regime they are partially screened by the carriers injected and captured by QWs and/or modified by forward-bias voltage and injected charge. As a result, the potential drop in the QW and adjacent barrier (i.e., barrier electric field) may be significantly reduced. This effect increases the transit flux for given \(n_{\rm bar}\) and \(p_{\rm bar}\). Still, for aquaminar-green \(c\)-plane LDs (where the polarization fields are high due to high In concentration), the transit times are significantly increased and carrier capture coefficient \(C\) is \(\sim\)70% for holes and \(\leq\)30% for electrons. At the same time, for nonpolar structure \(C\) is 30% and \(\leq\)10% for holes and electrons, respectively. Fig. 7 presents simulated band diagrams and recombination-rate distributions among QWs for nonpolar and _c_-plane cases. Relatively, even carrier distribution among nonpolar QWs allows almost equal recombination rate among QWs. However, in _c_-plane structures due to the high hole-capture probability, most of holes are trapped in the top QW. The electrons, being more mobile still can reach the top QW. The population of the other QWs decreases roughly exponentially away from the p-side. This conclusion is in agreement with the experimental observations for blue-green LEDs, where the green QW placed next to p-side of the structure would provide much higher electroluminescence intensity than the other QWs positioned further away from the p-side [46]. This behavior holds for broad range of injection current densities, suitable for both LED (\(\sim\)10 A/cm\({}^{2}\)) and for LDs (\(>\)1 kA/cm\({}^{2}\)).

### _Carrier-Transport-Analysis Summary_

In summary, for short-wavelength light emitters, the carrier distribution among QWs is relatively equal because the carrier transit is faster compared to the capture and also the carrier escape is faster or comparable to the recombination rate, allowing more uniform carrier redistribution among QWs. For nonpolar and semipolar aquamarine-green light emitters, the escape rate is slow, but due to low electric field in the barriers, the fast carrier transit allows still relatively even carrier distribution among QWs. In aquamarine-green _c_-plane light emitters, the carrier concentration in QWs is strongly nonuniform because strong electric field in the barriers causes trapping of holes by the QWs positioned close to the p-side.

## V Optical Gain From Optically and Electrically Pumped MQW

Let us now consider the QW optical gain presented in Fig. 8. The peak gain value as a function of pumping power is slightly lower for the aquamarine _c_-plane QW than in the green semipolar QW, which is a result of QCSE that reduces electron-hole overlap, thus lowering recombination oscillator strength. Because of this effect, even lower optical gain in green spectral range from _c_-plane QWs was reported [1, 22]. Also, for the aquamarine _c_-plane QW we can see that the gain peak position strongly blue shifts with increased pumping, which is attributed to the screening of the QCSE [2, 14] by the pumped carriers. Indeed, the QCSE increases the emission wavelength, while its screening blue shifts it. It is, however, typical for the QW system that optical gain at short wavelength side of the gain peak decreases rapidly to negative value. As a result, at wavelengths around 480 nm, a QW pumped with power \(>\)6 kW/cm\({}^{2}\) will provide gain, while a less-pumped QW will provide gain at \(>\)490 nm and absorption at 480 nm wavelength. The blue shift of the QW optical gain also exists under EP, except not all QWs are pumped equally. We can see from the band-diagram simulation in Fig. 7(b) the strong electric field in the QW, indicating strong QCSE. Under EP in LD operation regime for each QW the electric field typically remains significant, although it is partially screened by injected carriers and radiative recombination transition energies in each QW are mainly determined by pumped carrier density. This situation remains for MQW structures with number of QWs from 2 to 5. Because of the screening, the gain behavior shown in Fig. 8(b) takes place under EP as well. As concluded in the previous section, there is a strong pumping nonuniformity among _c_-plane LD QWs for EP. Knowing this nonuniformity and using the measured and extrapolated optical gain per QW, we can estimate total optical gain of MQW as a function of recombination current in MQW. Since the total optical loss in our LDs is approximately 15 cm\({}^{-1}\) (based on internal optical loss measurement [47] and facet reflectivity), we can estimate recombination current needed to achieve lasing condition. The estimated current is presented in Fig. 8(c) for structures with varied number of QWs. In the case of several periods of c-plane QWs, the top QW provides optical gain, while the bottom QW (or QWs) provides spectrally selective optical absorption (i.e., the absorption that is only present, or is much stronger, at shorter wavelengths). The spectrally selective absorption effect increases with the number of QWs, while the net MQW gain peak and lasing wavelength shift to longer wavelengths. However, much higher current density is needed to overcome this absorption and reach the lasing threshold, as we can see in Fig. 8(c). This trend is in very good agreement with the LD threshold characteristics presented in Fig. 2, which confirms validity of our model. We can see, however, that the estimated recombination current in Fig. 8(c) is overall lower than the LD threshold currents in Fig. 2. We attribute this difference to non-100% injection coefficient, i.e., electron overflow through the active region, and delocalized carriers heating increasing electron-hole transport asymmetry.

The situation is different in green semipolar lasers. The optical gain of a given QW does not experience a strong blue shift since the QCSE is much smaller for both OP and EP. At the wavelength around 510 nm, even at \(<\)6 kW/cm\({}^{2}\), there is a rather small (or no) absorption, while at higher pumping power the gain in the 510-520 nm range increases faster than for

\(c\)-plane QWs in the 480-495 nm range. In addition, the EP power uniformity among the QWs is predicted to be better. Fig. 8(c) shows significantly weaker dependence on the number of QWs of the recombination current needed to achieve desired modal gain. Again, this is in agreement with LD threshold characteristics presented in Fig. 2, and closer lasing wavelengths between OP and EP measurements.

## VI Conclusion

We found that for aquamarine-green LDs, a different kind of carrier transport phenomena determines the laser performance, such as the threshold and lasing wavelength, compared to violet-blue LDs. While in short-wavelength light emitters the carrier escape from the QWs is fast, allowing the carrier redistribution among MQWs, in the aquamarine-green light emitters, it is not the case. Carrier transit rate from one QW to another and capture rate determine the carrier distribution among the QWs in this case. We show that in the aquamarine-green spectral range the ballistic carrier transport from one QW to another and the carrier capture to QWs have to be considered. We develop a rate-equation model to simulate this process. The model calculates thermoactivated emission and tunneling carrier transport between neighboring QWs and between MQW and passive regions. The capture probability is higher for holes than for electrons. In \(c\)-plane laser structures, the triangular barrier shape makes the tunneling process a dominant mechanism over the thermoactivated emission. This makes the carrier transit slower, and therefore, capture probability higher, compared with that in the semipolar and nonpolar structures. As a result, the holes are trapped in the top QWs, leaving the rest of QWs underpumped. Also, due to the strong QCSE in \(c\)-plane QW, the optical gain peak is blue shifted for higher pumping power, while the underpumped QWs provide absorption at this peak wavelength. Much higher current density is required to compensate the absorption by the underpumped QWs such that the threshold current increases significantly for LDs with the number of QWs greater than 2. Selective absorption by underpumped QWs also shifts the lasing peak position to a longer wavelength. In semipolar LD structures, this effect is not prominent due to faster carrier transit and less gain peak position shift under pumping.
