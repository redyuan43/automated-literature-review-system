###### Abstract

In vivo monitoring of drought stress and salinity stress of Turkey Berry plant (Solanum Torvum) by means of horizontal integrated in the plant has been explored. Preliminary results obtained using the bioristor show promise for evaluating these stresses.

## I Introduction

Abbotic stress is defined as negative impact of non-living factors on living organisms in a specific environment. Drought stress and salinity stress are the two most prominent abiotic stresses on crop plants responsible for reduction of agricultural yields worldwide. Drought is a climatic phenomenon that can cause physiological damage to plants. In higher plants, transport of most of mineral nutrients from the soil to the roots is dependent on the moisture in the soil [1]. Drought stress reduces photosynthesis, affects plant water relations, disturbs plant nutrient relations, and consequently decreases crop productivity. Presence of excess sodium chloride (NaCl) in soil that eventually gets absorbed by plants growing in the soil results in salt stress in the plants. For most of the plants, Na\({}^{+}\) is not an essential mineral [2]. Various physiological processes such as seed germination and plant development are affected by salt stress, as a result detrimentally affecting crop yields worldwide.

Bioristor is a type of OECT (Organic Electrochemical Transistor) developed on cotton thread with plant sap acting as electrolyte. It is a bio-imimetic biosensor that can be inserted directly into plant tissue, enabling in vivo, real time and continuous monitoring of variations in solute content of plant sap. Key parts of bioristor are plant sap acting as electrolyte, cotton thread functionalized with conducting polymer that is in contact with electrolyte (behaves as channel), gate (G) electrode submersed in electrolyte. The channel of OECT is typically made of a conducting polymer [3]. The most popular material used as conducting polymer for OECT is PEDOT: PSS (poly (3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate), owing mainly to its commercial availability in the form of aqueous dispersions [1]. In this degenerately doped p-type system, fixed negative charges exist along the PSS background and these are compensated by positive holes along the PEDOT polymer chain. These positive holes are very mobile and in the presence of voltage drop across source and drain (V\({}_{\text{SD}}\)), they easily move resulting in current I\({}_{\text{SD}}\).

On applying positive charge on gate electrode (by applying a potential V\({}_{\text{OS}}\)) that is immersed in plant sap, positive ions from the plant sap (Na\({}^{\prime}\), K\({}^{\prime}\), Ca\({}^{\text{2+}}\), Mg\({}^{\text{2-}}\)) are encouraged to penetrate into PEDOT:PSS channel in order to maintain charge neutrality causing its dedoping according to equation (1):

\[\text{PEDOT}^{\text{+}}\text{; PSS}^{\text{+}}\text{ Y}^{\text{+}}+\text{e}^{ \text{-}}\text{PEDOT}^{\text{0+}}\text{ Y}^{\text{+}}\text{: PSS}^{\text{-}} \tag{1}\]

where Y\({}^{\text{+}}\) is positive ion from plant sap which is less mobile as compared to positive hole.

So, for the same electric field across source and drain, current I\({}_{\text{SD}}\) is lowered. This process is reversible [4] and when V\({}_{\text{GS}}\) is made 0 V, ions diffuse from PEDOT: PSS channel to the electrolyte resulting in maximum value of I\({}_{\text{SD}}\) once again. This process is called doping. This doping and dedoping does not happen instantaneously but has a characteristic rise time associated with it. Thus, this PEDOT: PSS-based OECT is a depletion mode p-type device (normally ON device); upon applying a positive gate voltage, drain current [5], is modulated from I\({}_{\text{MAX}}\) to zero [6].

Na\({}^{\text{+}}\), K\({}^{\text{+}}\), Ca\({}^{\text{2+}}\), Mg\({}^{\text{2+}}\) ions are the key players in drought stress response\({}^{\text{+}}\) while Na\({}^{\text{i}}\) ion is the key player in salinity stress response. In this paper, we present preliminary results on bioristor to monitor drought stress and salinity stress in crop plants.

## II Experimental

### Construction of Bioristor

Commercial cotton fibers are functionalized by soaking them for 5 min. in aqueous PEDOT:PSS and drying in hot air oven at 60\({}^{\text{o}}\)C for 30 min. Treated fiber is directly inserted through stem of plant with the two ends acting as source and drain terminals. Thin silver wire is used as gate electrode and is set at about 5 mm distance from the functionalized cotton fibre.

Drought stress in a plant increases K, Ca and Na content and decreases Mg content in the plant[7]. Drought stress inhibits the absorption of K\({}^{+}\) ion and increases the absorption of Na\({}^{+}\) ion in various plants[8]. Thus in a drought stressed plant, more positive ions from plant sap penetrate channel of bioristor resulting in lesser availability of holes for current conduction. Hence lower values of I\({}_{\text{SD}}\) are observed in the case of drought stressed Turkey Berry plants as compared to that of healthy Turkey Berry plants. The trend followed by the current waveform in both healthy and drought stressed plants is similar for different values of V\({}_{\text{GS}}\). Slope of transfer characteristics is comparable for healthy and drought stressed plants as shown in figures 2. (a), 2. (b), 2. (c).

Under salt stress, higher concentrations of salts (of Na, K and Mg) in plants hampers the transport of Mg\({}^{2+}\), Ca\({}^{2+}\) and K\({}^{+}\) into plants[9]. Thus in a salt stressed plant, lesser positive ions from plant sap penetrate channel of bioristor resulting in higher availability of holes for current conduction. Hence higher values of I\({}_{\text{SD}}\) are observed in the case of salt stressed plants as compared to drought stressed plants. The trend followed by the current waveform in both healthy and salt stressed plants is similar for different values of V\({}_{\text{GS}}\). Slope of transfer characteristics is higher for healthy plant as compared to that of salt stressed plant as shown in figures 3. (a), 3. (b), 3. (c).

A clear shift in transfer characteristics is observed for drought stressed and salinity stressed plants as compared to that of healthy plant. This demonstrates that the bioristor is capable of detecting changes in concentration of ions involved in drought stress response and salinity stress response. Output characteristic of bioristor integrated in healthy plant is observed to be almost linear for V\({}_{\text{GS}}\) = 0 V as shown in figure 4.

## IV Conclusion

From preliminary studies, it is clearly evident that the bioristor is capable of detecting changes in concentration of the various ions in a plant during drought stress and salinity stress. More detailed experiments will be needed to understand the phenomena in further detail.
