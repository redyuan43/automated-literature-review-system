In the past few years, \(\beta\)-gallium oxide (\(\beta\)-Ga\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)) has drawn much attention as an ultrawide bandgap semiconductor due to its remarkable intrinsic properties, including

The metal/TiO\({}_{2}\)/\(\beta\)-Ga\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) diode exhibited an on-resistance of 3.3 m\(\Omega\)-cm\({}^{2}\) and a breakdown voltage of 1010 V, which provides a simple and effective method for \(\beta\)-Ga\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) to achieve a high reverse breakdown voltage for high voltage and high power applications.

## 2 Device Fabrication and Measurement

The energy band diagram of the dielectric heterojunction diode can be divided into two types according to the conduction band offset between insulator and semiconductor by the definition of \(\Delta E_{C}=(E_{C-{\rm insulator}}-E_{C-{\rm Ga}_{2}{\rm O}_{3}})\). As shown in Fig. 1(a), with the positive value of \(\Delta E_{C}\), the electrons tunneling through the metal-semiconductor (MS) interface are blocked by the high barrier of insulator under reverse bias, which can effectively reduce the reverse leakage current. However, the forward current will also decrease in the presence of \(\Delta E_{C}\) under forward bias [19]. While with the negative value of \(\Delta E_{C}\), the electrons can pass through the insulator without obstruction under forward bias. On the other hand, under reverse bias, the carriers can move from anode to cathode only by tunneling through the triangular barrier at the dielectric/\(\beta\)-Ga\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) heterojunction without the influence of the dielectric, resulting in a larger reverse leakage current. In summary, if the absolute value of \(\Delta E_{C}\) is kept small enough, the high-performance MDS diode can be demonstrated with a large breakdown voltage while maintaining good forward conduction characteristics with low on-resistance.

In the following, the band alignments between the available dielectrics and \(\beta\)-Ga\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) are presented [20, 21] and the values of conduction band offset are also marked in Fig. 2. It is found that the material with a large value of \(\Delta E_{C}\) can only be used as an insulating gate dielectric layer in gallium oxide MOSFET such as SiO\({}_{2}\), Al\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\), HfO\({}_{2}\), and ZrO\({}_{2}\). However, with a small value of \(\Delta E_{C}\), the material can be used as an insulating layer in the dielectric heterojunction diodes, such as BaTiO\({}_{3}\)[19].

In order to study the band alignment of Ga\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) and TiO\({}_{2}\), three samples of A (Ga\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) bulk), B (20-nm TiO\({}_{2}\)), and C (3-nm TiO\({}_{2}\)/Ga\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)) were performed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement with Thermo Scientific K-Alpha XPS system using the monochromatic soft Al K\(\alpha\) (1486.6 eV) X-ray source. The TiO\({}_{2}\) layers with a thickness of 3 and 20 nm were grown directly on the \(\beta\)-Ga\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) substrates by a Modern Chemistry Research Institute (MCRI) FH-2 atomic layer deposition (ALD) system (Xi'an MCRI, Xi'an, China). The Ti(DiPt)\({}_{4}\) precursor container was kept at 40 \({}^{\circ}\)C and a stream of N\({}_{2}\) was pushed through the container at a rate of 50 sccm to carry the Ti(DiPt)\({}_{4}\) vapor to the ALD reactor. The partial pressure of H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) injected to the ALD reactor was controlled at about 0.1 Torr by adjusting the regulating valve upstream to the ALD reactor.

The equation of conduction band offset \(\Delta E_{C}\) is expressed as follows:

\[\Delta E_{C}=E_{G}^{\rm TiO_{2}}-E_{G}^{\rm Ga_{2}O_{3}}-\Delta E_{V}\]

where \(E_{G}^{\rm TiO_{2}},E_{G}^{\rm Ga_{2}O_{3}}\), and \(\Delta E_{V}\) are the bandgaps for TiO\({}_{2}\), Ga\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\), and the valence band offset for TiO\({}_{2}\)/Ga\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) interface, respectively. The photograph excitation and photoemission of electrons with inelastic energy loss during XPS measurement can be used to quantify the bandgap characters for TiO\({}_{2}\) and Ga\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\). As mentioned in the previous literature [22, 23, 24], the bandgap values can be identified by analyzing the energy loss peak of the \(O\) 1-s spectrum obtained from XPS survey spectra. The \(O\) 1-s core levels and energy loss peaks of TiO\({}_{2}\) and Ga\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) are shown in Fig. 3. The separation between the core-level peak energy and the onset of inelastic loss (obtained by the intersection of the sharply decreasing region of the spectrum with the baseline) is equal to the bandgap of the material. The bandgap values of Ga\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)(Sample A), TiO\({}_{2}\)(Sample B) are determined to be 4.9 and 3.2 eV, respectively.

According to the method provided by Kraut _et al._[25], the valence band offset \(\Delta E_{V}\) can be expressed as

\[\Delta E_{V}=\left(E_{\rm CL}^{\rm Ga_{2}O_{3}}-E_{\rm VBM}^{\rm Ga _{2}O_{3}}\right)-\left(E_{\rm CL}^{\rm TiO_{2}}-E_{\rm VBM}^{\rm TiO_{2}}\right)\] \[-\left(E_{\rm CL(Ga_{2}O_{3})}^{\rm Ga_{2}O_{3}/TiO_{2}}-E_{\rm CL (TiO_{2})}^{\rm Ga_{2}O_{3}/TiO_{2}}\right)\]

where \(E_{\rm CL}^{\rm Ga_{2}O_{3}}\) and \(E_{\rm VBM}^{\rm Ga_{2}O_{3}}\) are the core levels and valence band maximum (VBM) binding energies of Ga\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) (Sample A), \(E_{\rm CL}^{\rm TiO_{2}}\) and \(E_{\rm VBM}^{\rm TiO_{2}}\) are the core level and VBM binding energy of TiO\({}_{2}\)(Sample B), respectively. \(E_{\rm CL(Ga_{2}O_{3})}^{\rm Ga_{2}O_{3}/TiO_{2}}\) and \(E_{\rm CL(TiO_{2})}^{\rm Ga_{2}O_{3}/TiO_{2}}\) correspond to the energy differences between Ga\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) core level and TiO\({}_{2}\) core level of the TiO\({}_{2}\)/Ga\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) interface (Sample C).

As shown in Fig. 4(a)-(c), the numerical calculation results of \(\Delta\,E_{V}\) is \(-1.4\) eV. Based on the calculated bandgaps, the energy band diagrams for the TiO\({}_{2}\)/Ga\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) interfaces are demonstrated in Fig. 4(d), which indicates that the investigated TiO\({}_{2}\)/Ga\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) interfaces are the type I band alignment with the \(\Delta\,E_{C}\) of \(-0.3\) eV.

In addition to \(\Delta\,E_{C}\), the dielectric constant of the material is another important parameter [19]. Under a large reverse bias, the material with large dielectric constant \(\varepsilon\) has a relatively flat conduction band profile, which can effectively prevent the electron tunneling and reduce the reverse leakage current. While under forward bias, the current injected through the insulating layer can be expressed as

\[J\sim\mu\varepsilon V^{2}/L^{3} \tag{1}\]

where \(\mu\) is the electron mobility, \(\varepsilon\) is the dielectric constant, and \(L\) is the thickness of the dielectric. According to (1), at a given bias voltage, the higher the dielectric constant, the lower the voltage drop across the dielectric, thus increasing the forward current. Due to the \(\Delta\,E_{C}\) of \(-0.05\) eV and dielectric constant of 40, TiO\({}_{2}\) may be a preferable choice used in MDS diodes [20, 21].

In the following, the fabrication of \(\beta\)-Ga\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) MDS diode is presented. As shown in Fig. 5(a), the 650 \(\mu\)m bulk \(n^{+}\) substrates with Sn doping concentration of 1.6 \(\times\) 10\({}^{19}\) cm\({}^{-3}\) (5.0 \(\times\) 5.0 \(\times\) 0.65 mm\({}^{3}\)) were grown by edge-defined film-fed growth (EFG) and the lightly doped 8-\(\mu\)m-thick \(n^{-}\beta\)-Ga\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) (001) layers with the electron concentration of 2.5 \(\times\) 10\({}^{16}\) cm\({}^{-3}\) were deposited by halide vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE). Ohmic contact on the backside of the \(n^{+}\beta\)-Ga\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) bulk was formed with the metal stack of Ti/Au (20 nm/100 nm) deposited by E-beam evaporation and rapid thermal annealed at 550 \({}^{\circ}\)C for 1 min under nitrogen atmosphere. After ultrasonic cleaning in acetone, ethanol, and deionized (DI) water for 10 min in each solvent, the TiO\({}_{2}\) layer with a thickness of 20 nm was grown directly on the \(\beta\)-Ga\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) substrates. Finally, the circular Schottky anode electrodes were formed by evaporation of Ni/Au (40 nm/100 nm) metal stack with diameters of 100 \(\mu\)m patterned by ultraviolet (UV) photolithography and lift-off process.
