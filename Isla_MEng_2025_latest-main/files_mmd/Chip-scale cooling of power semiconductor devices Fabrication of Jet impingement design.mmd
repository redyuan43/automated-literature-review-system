## I Introduction

Power electronics packaging has traditionally been targeted toward the use of silicon-based (Si) semiconductor devices such as insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs). As described in [1], standard high-power electronics packaging technology typically comprises a bare die soldered to a substrate, e.g. direct bond copper (DBC), which is then soldered to a heat spreader. A cold plate is then mechanically attached to the electronics package with an intermediary thermal interface material (TIM). This longstanding method provides means for proper electrical isolation and connection to the power device plus thermal pathways for dissipation of waste heat. Variations of this "remote" cooling strategy, Fig. 1(a), where the cold plate is connected to an external surface of the power module, often require size reduction efforts and experience coefficient of thermal expansion mismatch in the package leading to thermally induced stress. Furthermore, conductive thermal resistance between the cold plate and power device is a common roadblock to achieving lower device temperatures as heat flux increases. Thus, while effective, the established packaging approach for Si devices presents challenges for next-generation higher power density wide band-gap (WBG) devices such as silicon carbide (SiC) or gallium nitride (GaN).

Wide band-gap devices have lower losses and enable higher switching frequencies, which permits the reduction of the size of the inductors and capacitors in a typical power control unit boost converter, as explained by Hamada et al. [2]. Up to 80% downsizing of a power control unit is anticipated in the future representing a significant increase in system power density. At the power semiconductor die level, concomitant heat fluxes of 1 kW/cm\({}^{2}\), up from current Si IGBT levels of 100-250 W/cm\({}^{2}\), must be handled for WBG devices, per Bar-Cohen et al. [3]. Additionally, from an electrical performance perspective, novel low parasitic inductance packaging schemes should be investigated to maximize the benefits of WBG power devices; see for example Huang et al. [4]. Accordingly, pioneering strategies for power-dense device packaging are required to circumvent the size, electrical, mechanical, and thermal bottlenecks of standard Si-based high-power electronics packaging technology.

One innovation for compact packaging and advanced thermal management of WBG power devices is "embedded" cooling, where the coolant liquid is brought near to the point of heat generation, i.e. the device junction. In [3], impressive examples of embedded cooling are presented for extreme heat flux, 30 kW/cm\({}^{2}\), lateral current GaN high electron-mobility

transistors (HEMTs) for RF power amplifiers. In [5], Vladimirova, et al. investigated drift region integrated parallel microchannels for the direct cooling of vertical power PIN diodes, although concerns were identified in terms of modification of the device electrical performance, e.g. current distribution. More recently, Dede, et al. [6] proposed three concepts for embedded cooling of vertical current WBG semiconductor devices. These concepts include: 1) embedding the microchannels directly into the bottom region of the power device, 2) embedding the microchannels into the lower electrode of the device, or 3) bonding the vertical current power device directly to a Si cooling chip with embedded microchannels plus thru silicon vias (TSVs) for electrical function, as illustrated in Fig. 1(b). Here, we select Si for the cooling chip due to its good thermal-mechanical properties plus ease of manufacturing. In addition, non-doped Si may serve as an insulator between the electrical path and coolant flow path. In [7], the first concept from [6] was explored in depth by Jung et al. using a one-dimensional thermal-fluidic modeling approach, and analytical estimations indicated that \(\sim\)1 kW/cm\({}^{2}\) heat fluxes may be cooled with WBG device temperatures less than 200 \({}^{\circ}\)C. As part of DARPA's ICECool program described in [8], Drummond et al. [9] recently demonstrated embedded two-phase cooling of heat fluxes up to 910 W/cm\({}^{2}\) using a Si-based hierarchical manifold microchannel heat sink, although the reported pressure drop was noticeable at 162 kPa and five stacked and bonded wafers were required for the complex heat sink assembly. Through this brief survey, we can observe that the field of embedded cooling is gaining momentum.

While truly embedding the cooling structure within the device itself likely provides the greatest compactness and highest thermal performance, there are significant challenges associated with fabricating microchannels in extremely thin (i.e. much less than 250 \(\upmu\)m) next-generation WBG power devices. Additionally, as identified in [5], the embedded cooling structure may have unintended consequences for the electrical performance of the device. Thus, this manuscript builds off the work in [6] and the concept for a separately fabricated and bonded Si cooling chip, as shown in Fig. 1(b).

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II., an overview is provided of the straight microchannel chip-scale cooler from [6], and the new jet impingement design is introduced. The layer-by-layer fabrication of the jet impingement chip-scale cooler is described in Sec. III. Conclusions are provided in Sec. IV along with a brief discussion of ongoing work.

## II Chip-Scale Cooler Overview

In this section, the prior straight microchannel chip-scale cooler is briefly reviewed. This is followed by the introduction of the new jet impingement chip-scale cooler design. A thermal-fluid performance estimation based on prior numerical studies is summarized.

### _Straight Microchannel Design_

A cross-section schematic of a two-layer straight microchannel chip-scale cooler is shown in Fig. 2(a). Layer 2 has two holes for both inlet and outlet and is bonded to Layer 1 to provide a leak-tight microchannel seal. After entering the inlet hole, fluid proceeds through an inlet manifold and travels through an array of straight microchannels positioned below a 1 cm\({}^{2}\) heat source region. Fluid then passes through an outlet manifold prior to exiting the device. Previously, the device was tested up to heat fluxes of 130 W/cm\({}^{2}\), as reported in [6]. Performance characteristics associated with the straight microchannel design were identified to include large device pressure drop (\(\Delta P\)-40 kPa) and temperature gradients (\(\Delta T\)-30 \({}^{\circ}\)C) as the fluid is pumped through the 12-mm microchannel length. This relatively large temperature gradient may cause non-uniform operation of the power device degrading performance under high current density conditions. Thus, the fabrication of a new chip-scale cooler design is considered to improve on these points by utilizing distributed fluid jet impingement plus flow through optimized branching microchannels. Additional details follow.

### _Jet Impingement Design_

The cross-section schematic of the three-layer jet impingement chip scale cooler design is shown in Fig. 2(b). The key concept for this new design is to distribute the cool fluid via the jet array. So, the orientation of the flow path is changed from lateral straight channels to vertical jets. This design follows the micro heat exchanger design principles set forth by Harpole and Eninger [10], and builds off original studies in [11]. Specifically, fluid enters the inlet hole and travels through a fluid manifold in Layer 3, where it is distributed to a \(12\times 12\) array of jet orifices. From there, the fluid jets emitting from Layer 2 impinge 144 microchannel unit cells in Layer 1 for a total cooled area of 6 mm \(\times\) 6 mm.

At each Layer 1 unit cell, fluid flows radially outward from the jet impingement location (i.e. stagnation point) to the cell edges. Finally, fluid empties from the cell edges into an outlet manifold in Layer 2 and flows to the outlet hole of the device.

Expected benefits of this chip-scale cooler include a more uniform chip temperature due to the distributed array of fluid jets, an approximate order-of-magnitude lower pressure drop for the same fluid flow rate due to the manifold and unit cell architecture, and an estimated 70% higher heat transfer coefficient for the same pumping power when compared with the straight microchannel design. The reader is referred to [6, 11] for additional flow structure design and performance details.

## III Fabrication of Jet Impingement Design

Six-inch double-side polished silicon wafers of 490 \(\upmu\)m thickness are used for fabrication. Approximately 2 \(\upmu\)m thick silicon oxide (SiO\({}_{2}\)) is grown on the surfaces of the wafers, which is patterned and used as the mask for the Si etching. The cooling structure in each wafer is dry etched using the Bosch process with a customized recipe. The etched wafers are directly bonded together to create a monolithic structure. After that, the bonded wafer stacks are diced and metallized for testing. Additional process details are provided below.

### _Mask Layout & Layer Fabrication_

The cooler comprises three layers, and each layer requires two masks for the double-side etching, as seen in the process flow in Fig. 3. The first layer has a relatively simple structure and no through holes. The front surface only has alignment marks and dicing lines etched. The optimized cooling structure is then etched on the back side of Layer 1. The front surface is etched first followed by the back surface. An optical microscope image of the cooling structure on the back surface is shown in Fig. 4.

The unique microchannel design is obtained using topology optimization for conjugate heat transfer, as explained in [11], to minimize both the average temperature of the cooled region and the flow resistance through the microchannels. The minimum spacing between the fins is within the range of \(w\)-20-30 \(\upmu\)m, and the fin height is about \(H\)-250-300 \(\upmu\)m for a high channel aspect ratio, \(H\)/\(w\), ranging from 8.3:1 to 15:1.

Layer 2 of the chip-scale cooler is the most challenging to fabricate. It has small etched features, i.e. square nozzle posts, residing in a larger etched feature, i.e. the fluid outlet manifold. Also, there are small nozzle orifice through holes in the posts plus a larger outlet through hole in the manifold. The ratio of the diameter of the nozzle orifices to the fluid outlet hole is 12.5:1. Due to the existence of through holes, the wafers were mounted on supporting wafers with mounting oil, Santovac 5, to prevent damage to the etching tool. The wide range of feature size leads to a nonuniform etching rate. On top of that, the etching depth of the orifices is the thickness of the wafer, 490 \(\upmu\)m, while the etching depth of the outlet is the thickness of the wafer less the 275 \(\upmu\)m depth of the outlet manifold. Therefore, if these through holes are etched from one side, say the back side, then the outlet is etched through at a much faster rate than the nozzle orifices, exposing the Si surface within the outlet manifold to the etching gas for the remainder of the etching period. This causes over-etching of the square nozzle post features in the manifold pocket and also generates a difficult to clean byproduct due to the reaction between echant and the mounting oil. Hence, due to the unique design characteristics associated with the chip-scale cooling device, there are two critical points for the fabrication of the second layer: 1. The orifices should be etched from both sides instead of a single side; 2. The back-side etching should be performed first followed by the etching of the front side. As a result, the uniformly etched nozzle orifices are shown in the optical microscope image in Fig. 5. Note that Layer 3 of the chip-scale cooler design has a similar structure to Layer 2 but with less complicated features, and thus it was etched in similar manner.

### _Wafer Bonding and Dicing_

After the three individual wafers are processed, they then go through the necessary pre-bond cleaning. The wafers are aligned and bonded using direct Si-to-Si fusion bonding followed by annealing at 1050 \({}^{\circ}\)C in a nitrogen, N\({}_{2}\), atmosphere for two hours in an Angstrom Engineering Furnace. The bonded wafer stack is diced into individual cooling chips. After that, a 5 mm \(\times\) 5 mm titanium, nickel, gold (Ti/Ni/Au) metallization layer, for eventual power device or thermal test chip die attachment, is deposited on the center region of the chip. The as-fabricated jet impingement chip-scale cooling device is 1/4\({}^{\text{th}}\) the size of the straight channel device, as shown in Fig. 6.

## IV Conclusions

The concept of chip-scale cooling for future-generation power semiconductor devices was introduced. A previous straight microchannel device was reviewed, and performance challenges were identified. A new jet impingement chip-scale cooling structure was then described, and expected benefits of the design were discussed. An overview of the fabrication process was provided including a unique double-side etching technique required for realization of the application specific cooling structure topology. Continuing work includes process development to realize TSV electrical functionality. Integration of the existing prototype device into a test bench for experimental thermal-fluid performance evaluation is ongoing.
