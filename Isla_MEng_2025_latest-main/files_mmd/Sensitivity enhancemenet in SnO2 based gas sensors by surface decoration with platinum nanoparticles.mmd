## I Introduction

In the last two decades, the use of gas sensors based on oxide semiconductor thin films as resistive gas sensors (RGS) has continuously increased [1-7]. More recently, applying a tin oxide-based RGS for the fabrication of a single sensor gas discriminating element, similar to an electronic nose, created another market niche for these devices [8-10]. Cost reduction, enhancement of the quality factors and advances in the deposition techniques are the driving forces behind the engineering research being perused in this technological field [4, 7, 11, 12].

An RGS sensor operates based on the variation of its sensing pallet resistivity with respect to the presence of reducing gases in the surrounding atmosphere [13, 14]. Among the gas sensitive materials used for pallet fabrication, SnO\({}_{2}\) is the most popular as it provides high gas sensitivity and chemical and physical stability [4]. Owing to the simple structure and low cost deposition equipment required, spray pyrolysis is a popular technique among the wide variety of deposition techniques utilized for the growth of tin oxide layers on different substrates. The method produces high quality thin films of controlled thickness [11, 15-18].

Metal oxide gas sensors are highly temperature dependent [1, 4, 9] and gas detection sensitivity significantly decreases when the temperature deviates from the optimum temperature [13]. The optimum temperature for these devices is relatively high, which is their major drawback. Moreover, the sensitivity of these devices intrinsically is poor and sensitization is required for the detection of low concentrations gases in the surrounding atmospheres [12]. Since the interaction of the target gas (TG) and the sensitive oxide takes place mainly at the apparent surface of the thin film RGS [19], surface modifications with noble metals such as Pd, Pt and Ag activators sensitizes the surface and enhances the sensing abilities in these sensors [1, 7].

In this industrially oriented research work, we produce SnO\({}_{2}\) thin films using a modified homemade USP deposition system. Active surfaces of a number of the produced samples are sensitized by electrodeposition of Pt nanoparticles with controlled particle size. Fabricated devices are examined at different conditions.

### _Experimental_

Thin layers of SnO\({}_{2}\) are deposited on SiO\({}_{2}\) substrates of 10 mm\(\times\)10 mm\(\times\)2 mm dimensions by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis technique. The schematic diagram of the system is shown in Fig. 1. Before deposition, the substrate surfaces are washed with absolute acetone, rinsed with deionized water, and dried with hot air blow. The starting solution is the 0.1 M solution of SnCl\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{2}\)O (Merck, 107815) in absolute ethanol. As shown in Fig. 1, a piezoelectric ultrasound generator operating at 900 kHz, generates aerosol droplets from the precursor. Since the precursor is highly corrosive, the piezoelectric source is maintained in a water filled tank and separated from the precursor container with a thin polymer sheet. The aerosol generated is transported by air as a carrier gas with a flow rate of 0.1 lit/min. The aerosol is transported to the deposition chamber where it strikes the substrate surface heated to 400 \({}^{\circ}\)C over a microheater. The substrate temperature is monitored with a fine S-type thermocouple and controlled with the variation of the voltage applied to the microheater. All the system parameters are kept constant; deposits of different thicknesses were achieved by varying the deposition time. Production of layers with sheet resistances in the range of 1000 Ohm/\(\Box\) takes about 3 min.

Platinum nanoparticles were electrochemically deposited onto tin oxide covered substrates from AlCl\({}_{2}\)-NaCl molten salt containing K\({}_{2}\)PHCl\({}_{6}\) at 120 \({}^{\circ}\)C using pulsed potential electrodeposition [20-23]. The electrodeposition is performed in a three-electrode electrochemical cell using the tin oxide coated substrate as the working electrode, platinum rod as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. The potential of the working electrode is computer-controlled by a \(\mu\)AUTOLAB Type III potentiostat/galvanostat (Metrohm-Autolab, Netherlands) using GPES software. Fig. 2 shows the schematic diagram of the electrodeposition voltage waveform applied. The upper potential limit (\(V_{\mathrm{u}}\)), lower potential limit (\(V_{\mathrm{i}}\)) and the upper potential pulse duration (\(t_{\mathrm{s}}\)), lower potential pulse duration (\(t_{\mathrm{s}}\)) are 0.6V versus Ag/AgCl, -0.15V versus Ag/AgCl, 4.95s and 0.05s, respectively.

The crystal structure of the SnO\({}_{2}\) layers is studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using CuK\(\alpha\) radiation, the scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX). The results are utilized for morphological and compositional comparisons between the pure SnO\({}_{2}\) and Pt decorated samples. The results are presented in the following section.

Two parallel silver lines are printed on each SnO\({}_{2}\) layer, which are cemented to fine Pt wires to provide electrical connections to the outside circuitry. Gas sensitivity and electronic properties of different samples are examined by utilizing a two point probe measurement method carried out in a closed chamber of 2 liter volume. As shown in Fig. 3, the measurement system also includes an S-type thermocouple which is used for continuous reading of the temperature on the microbacter surface.

### _Result_

The XRD pattern obtained for the layers grown on by the ultrasonic spray pyrolysis system shown in Fig.1 on quartz substrates are presented in Fig. 4 where in the diffraction peaks are shown to be compatible to those of the SnO\({}_{2}\). The particle size calculated based on the peak width indicates an approximate average crystallite size of \(\sim\)40 nm. The EDAX pattern obtained for similar layers, shown in Fig. 5a, indicates only oxygen and tin peaks (the Au peak is related to the layer

deposited prior to EDAX and SEM examinations). A similar pattern is generated after the process of electrodeposition, which as shown in Fig. 4(b), indicates the same peaks plus those related to platinum.

The SEM micrographs obtained for the tin oxide layers grown is presented in Fig. 5(a) and b, respectively, indicating that both layer consist of crystalline SnO\({}_{2}\) aggregates of \(\sim\)100 nm average size. The aggregated crystallites are of much smaller size of \(\sim\)30 nm. Fig. 5(b) shows a similar microstructure, but the surface is decorated with Pt nanoparticles. Sample sensors are fabricated from both asdeposited SnO\({}_{2}\) and Pt-decorated SnO\({}_{2}\) layers. The response of each sample is measured by capsizing the contaminated atmosphere chamber over the sample sensor. The response level, defined as R/Ro, is calculated by the measurement of the sample resistance in clean air, Ro, and the contaminated atmosphere, R. The results, obtained at four different operating temperatures, are shown in Fig. 7 depicting higher responses for the Pt-decorated samples; the response of the Pt-decorated sample at the operating temperature of 275 \({}^{\circ}\)C is almost 4 times higher than the same obtained for the undecorated sample. The higher response levels and, hence, the higher sensitivity of the Pt- decorated samples, to the ethanol contaminated atmosphere are attributed to the catalysis role of the Pt nanoparticles in the reaction between ethanol molecules and the surface-bound oxygen atoms. Acceleration of this oxidation process increases the population of the oxygen vacancy which acts as donor impurity in most of the oxide semiconductors.

Further clarification of the catalytic behavior of the Pt nanoparticles is provided by comparing the operating temperature dependence of the response levels in decorated and undecorated sensors. This comparison is carried out by measuring the responses to the same contamination level at varying surface temperatures measured by the fine thermocouple attached to the sensitive surface of the sample sensors. The results are compared in Fig. 8 demonstrating that the optimum operating temperature of the surface-decorated sample takes place at 300 \({}^{\circ}\)C which is 25 \({}^{\circ}\)C lower than that in the undecorated samples. From an engineering point of view, lower operating temperatures are superior because of facilitating the device operation with lower power dissipation levels and decreasing the aging drifts [24]. Moreover, Fig. 8 demonstrates a resistance change by a factor of 12.0 in response to the presence of 500 ppm ethanol in air background; this depicts a performance similar to those of the commercially available SnO\({}_{2}\)-based gas sensors.

### _Conclusion_

An ultrasound spray pyrolysis system was designed, assembled and tested for laboratory scale deposition of a tin oxide layers on glass substrates from a tin chloride-based precursor. Parameters of the process are easy to control, and this feature of the system can be utilized for the fabrication of oxide layers suitable for variety of applications ranging from solar cells to gas sensors. The latter application was attended as an example, and fabrication of ethanol sensor, based on the deposited layers, was successfully demonstrated. For this purpose, the oxide layer was sensitized by surface decoration with Pt nanoparticles which were incorporated with a pulsed electrodeposition system; the effectiveness of the decoration with this method was demonstrated for the first time. The surface sensitized sample sensors were shown to have ethanol sensitivities comparable with those of commercial tin oxide-based gas sensors.
