## 1 Introduction

Recently, the mm-W radar is at the epicenter of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), such as the 77 GHz radar are well developed and employed in 71% of cases for Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB), with global radar market reaching 57.5 billion in 2022 expected by Yole Developement [1]. A great number of devices working at the 76-81 GHz spectrum resources have been developed [1, 2]. However, mm-W band application in automotive radar brings new challenges to the high-precision fabrication technology [3].

Note that microstrip patch is usually designed with narrow bandwidth in mm-W antenna [4]. Since slot coupling technology plays an obvious role in broadening the bandwidth of microstrip antenna [5], multilayer structure stacking for the signal coupling in 77 GHz millimeter wave antenna is an ideal manufacturing process. In addition, the substrate materials and stacking methods vary with application contexts. Low-Temperature Co-fired Ceramics (LTCC) and organic Printed Circuit Board (PCB) substrate are commonly used for traditional antenna [6]. M. M. _et al._ have designed a patch antenna with a single patch size of 1.1 \(\times\) 1.3 mm\({}^{2}\) and working at 79 GHz [6]. However, mm-W RF device on those substrates would suffer from the difficulty of large-panel scalability and the limitation of the cost [7]. Furthermore, in the co-firing process, the individual antenna is integrated with RF devices withstanding high temperature up to 800\({}^{\circ}\)C [8]. PCB is commonly used for antenna packaging. However, the performance of the final antenna packaging is suffered from the bulky interconnection between devices and PCB. What's more, the dimension of whole device packaging is usually overdesigned to compensate for the potential process deviation (\(>\)40 \(\mu\)m) [9]. Silicon substrate seems an alternative for sophisticated antenna three-dimension (3D) integration. However, the silicon substrate was limited by the parasitic capacitance, high loss, and significant surface-wave effect [10].

Glass provides fine electrical performance and high precision machining can be performed using advanced manufacturing technology. Depending on its composition, dielectric constants of glass can vary from 4.9 to 12 [9]. Given the excellent electrical properties, fine line width/spacing ability, and suitability for 3D integrating, the stacking of glass substrates can achieve high-density interconnects and be compatible with semiconductor processes. Meanwhile, the through glass vias (TGVs) can be formed by utilizing laser-induced wet etching (LIWE) for reducing the surface waves effect [11]. In addition, the dimension deviation caused by manufacturing process for metal lines and TGVs is less than 10 \(\mu\)m, and the minimum thickness of glass substrate is under 50 \(\mu\)m. Furthermore, the coefficient of thermal expansive (CTE) RF devices fabricated on glass is matched with silicon dies. A. O. Watanabe _et al._ have presented a Yagi-Uda antenna on a 100-\(\mu\)m glass as the core layer and stacked multiple metal layers [7].

In this letter, the mm-W automotive radar antenna using five-layer glass wafers stacking with TGV is proposed and demonstrated. The realization of high-precision multilayer coupling slot combines the multilayer stacking and high-density interconnects. The S11 and gain of the proposed mm-W antenna were studied by simulation and measurement.

## 2 Design of Millimeter Wave Antenna

Fig. 1 shows the schematic of antenna structure composed of multilayer glasses. The relative permittivity and loss tangent of the glass are 5.7 and 0.011 at 77 GHz, respectively (obtain from supplier). The proposed antenna with the size of 10 \(\times\) 9\(\times\) 1 mm\({}^{3}\) consists of five-layer glasses, of which the thickness of 1\({}^{\text{st}}\), 2\({}^{\text{nd}}\), and 5\({}^{\text{th}}\) layers are 230 \(\mu\)m, but 3\({}^{\text{rd}}\) and 4\({}^{\text{th}}\) layers are 100 \(\mu\)m. The whole structure has six layers of metal, including radiation patch, 1\({}^{\text{st}}\) cross slot for feeding signal to radiation patch, 2\({}^{\text{nd}}\) cross slot with grounded microstrip line to change current path, rectangular slot for coupling transmission line signal, transmission line, and feed port. The patch in the bottom layer is fabricated as the feed conversion structure of WR12 waveguide and microstrip line. The fed signal is coupled from the microstrip line (100 \(\mu\)m wide) to the two-layer slot (rectangular slot: 320 \(\mu\)m \(\times\) 1000 \(\mu\)m; cross slot: 320 \(\mu\)m \(\times\) 1120 \(\mu\)m). There are four square radiation patches with the length of 550 \(\mu\)m in the top layer. The size of the whole radiation area is about 1.5 \(\times\) 1.5 mm\({}^{2}\). Each glass layer with TGV is connected by Cu/Sn redistribution layer (RDL) and seal ring to decrease the coupling level. To release the thermal stress of large area Cu, a number of holes are designed in the RDL.

Fig. 2a shows the side view of the 3D-glass stacked antenna. The Cu/Sn bonding is employed for the electrical connection of metals on 5-layer glasses. The key processes of 5-layer wafers are shown in Fig. 2c and Fig. 2d, including the formation of TGVs by LIVE, electroplating filling, electroplating RDL, and seal ring, Cu/Sn bonding, electroless gold plating. According to layer thickness, through via is adopted for thick glass, while thin glass adopts blind via process.

## 3 Design Process Development and 3D Glass Wafer Stacking

### The Through-Vias Process

Fig. 2c shows the through-vias process in a 300-\(\mu\)m glass wafer. The LIVE is used to form TGV (diameter: 60 \(\mu\)m) in the incoming-wafer after cleaning. The high temperature caused by laser irradiation directly damages a limited area of glass, and form the embryos of through vias and blind vias realized respectively by moving the position of the laser focus to adjust the damage range of the glass. Anisotropic etching occurs because nanopores in the damaged region increase the contact area and lead to an etching gap with the undamaged region. Based on anisotropy, vias are formed in subsequent HF etching. After PVD sputtering barrier/seed layer (Cu: 1 \(\mu\)m; Ti: 0.2 \(\mu\)m), the TGVs are filled by electroplating without void in three electroplating stages distinguished by the current density from small to large. The excess Cu and Ti layer on the wafer surface are removed by chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) and wet etching respectively. After the re-deposition of 0.1 um/0.3-um Ti/Cu, Cu RDL is formed by electroplating followed the double-side photolithography, which has 6 um thickness. Notably, as shown in Fig. 2b, the RDL is fabricated with the stress-released holes except the microstrip line and radiation patch, in order to reduce the warpage caused by thermal stress of large-area electroplating.

Seal rings around the devices were fabricated on RDL for wafer bonding to form hermheric sealing and transmission line. When the bonding temperature is above the Sn melting temperature, Sn layers gradually turn to Cu\({}_{6}\)Sn\({}_{5}\) and then Cu\({}_{3}\)Sn [12]. To ensure bonding quality, the thicknesses of Cu (H\({}_{\text{Cu}}\)) and Sn (H\({}_{\text{Sn}}\)) is confirmed for satisfying two significant factors. On the one side, HC\({}_{\text{Cu}}\) is greater than H\({}_{\text{Sn}}\) (HC\({}_{\text{Cu}}\)/H\({}_{\text{Sn}}\geq\)1.32) [12]. On the other side, the minimum thickness of Sn, which is used as a buffer layer. One side of wafer is electroplated to form RDL (Cu: 6 \(\mu\)m) and seal ring (Cu/Sn: 3/2 \(\mu\)m), while the other side has 6-\(\mu\)m thick Cu RDL and 3-\(\mu\)m thick Cu seal ring; in addition, the width of seal ring is 100 \(\mu\)m. After etching photoresist and barrier/seed layer, the single-wafer process is done.

### The Blind-Vias Process

Due to fragile 100-um-thick wafer, 3\({}^{\text{rd}}\) and 4\({}^{\text{th}}\) layers are manufactured by blind-vias process as shown in Fig. 2d. In the process, blind vias are formed on the wafer, which are filled by single-sided electroplating. The upper diameter of vias is

60 \(\mu\)m, and the opening of the via is 30 \(\mu\)m at the depth of 100um. After CMP and wet etching, Cu RDL (6 \(\mu\)m) is formed by electroplating followed photolithography in the opening side of wafer with filled blind-vias, then photoresist stripping is carried out. Subsequently, the Cu seal-ring is electroplated on RDL, where the thickness is 6 \(\mu\)m, afterwards photoresist is stripped and barrier/seed layer is wet-etched.

To prevent wafer from breaking, one side of the wafer that has completed the process is temporarily bonded with the glass carrier before thinning. The mechanical grinding is employed for thinned wafer to 100 \(\mu\)m from the metal-free side. Then 6-\(\mu\)m thick Cu RDL and 3/2-\(\mu\)m thick Cu/Sn seal ring are fabricated on be-thinned side of wafer by two photolithography and two electroplating.

### Multilayer Stacking on Bonding

The bonding conditions including temperature, pressure, and time are set as 280 \({}^{\circ}\)C, 5 MPa and 30 min, respectively. The lithography machine is used to align the marks on the wafer, and then the wafers are held by a fixture, which usually hard to obvious offset. With sufficient time, a near eutectic composition of Cu\({}_{3}\)Sn would be achieved according to the thickness ratio at Cu/Sn/Cu bonding interface. During the bonding, mainly, Cu migrates into the Sn layer, and the Sn layer is transformed into Cu\({}_{3}\)Sn. According to Fig. 3, the 5-layer stacking structure is completed through bonding.

## IV Sample Inspection

After electroless gold plating and dicing, the process of single device is completed. It is measured that the pattern offset is within 10\(\mu\)m under a microscope and scanning electron microscope (SEM). In Fig. 3, multilayer stacking is achieved without delamination or large voids, which means the feasibility five-layer stacking process. The antenna structure employs the glass substrates of 230 \(\mu\)m and 100 \(\mu\)m, and the metal interconnection layer of 20 \(\mu\)m. The finished product is shown in the Fig. 4.

The measurement and simulation results presented in Fig. 5a show little difference, possibly because of the slight deviation between the measured waveguide port and the feed port of antenna [14]. Therefore, the effect of deviation on return loss has been simulated, as shown in Fig. 5a. The return loss has increased significantly due to slight deviation, and the simulation result of 0.1mm-deviation is more consistent with the measured results. The antenna shows a bandwidth of 15%, which covers the entire bandwidth of high-frequency of the automotive radar. According to Fig. 5b, the gain (7.4 dBi, maximum) in E-planes at 79 GHz shows that the idea of glass-based antenna is feasible, and its electrical properties can also be similar to other typical materials. Table I compares the gain, bandwidth and size with the millimeter wave antennas made of different materials. It can be seen that the proposed antenna by stacking of five glass wafers has good performance and small size.

## V Conclusion

In this letter, an mm-W antenna with compactness has been proposed and successfully demonstrated based on stacking of five glass wafers with metal lines and TGVs. The measured maximum gain is 7.4 dBi at 79 GHz. The manufacturing of antenna using glass wafer process and wafer stacking can provide process stability, improves the wiring ability and realize complex antenna design.
