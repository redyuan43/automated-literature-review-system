L Introduction Recent progress in the physics of Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films lies mainly in the field of structural and optical investigation. Anticipements are far less impressive in the field of electrical characterization, especially in transport phenomena (see e.g./1,2/). The main purpose of this work was to investigate the transport properties of charge carriers across LB multilayer assembly in order to get some insight into the transport, scattering and trapping mechanisms, as well as to determine the energy structure of conduction and trapping states of an LB film. We used in our studies an amphiphilic, surface active derivate of vNAADyl phthalocyanine, since this class of organic compounds is shown to be excellent model substances, convenient for design of LB multilayer assemblies /2-5/.

2 Electrical characteristics, their interpretation The amphiphilic compound - tetra(octadecylaminosilphanyl) vanadyl phthalocyanine (VOPhc) with four aliphatic "tails" (see Fig.1.a) was deposited on a polished hydrophophedized sil1-con substrate of p-type by standard LB technology. The LB multilayer assemblies of Y type were obtained with a different number of layers (n-6-50) (Fig.1.b). The top metallic electrode of Al or Bi was deposited by vacuum evaporation technique. Structural studies of the VOPhc LB films show that the thickness L of a monolayer is ca. 21A/3.4/; the flat "heads" of the VopMe molecules are oriented parallel /3/ or almost parallel /A/ to the plane of the substrate. The aliphatic chains are tilted with respect to the plane of the VOPhc molecule at mean angles of ca. 30 degrees /A/ (see Fig.1.b). The electric conductivity across the LB cell Si(p)/VOPhc/Me was measured in vacuo at different temperatures (T-200-300K).


In the SCLC regime we obtained non-linear S-shaped cv-characteristic (see Fig.2) which indicate that the transport of injected holes is trap-controlled, and that these carrier traps are of Gaussian distribution (see ref./6,p.307).

The mean depth E\({}_{t}\) of these traps was determined by thermally modulated SCLS method (TM-SCLC) /7,8/.

This method allows to determine the activation energy E\({}_{a}\) of conductivity and its electric field dependence E\({}_{a}\)-f\({}_{b}\)(see Fig.2, curve 2) using cyclic fractional carrier detrapping in a narrow (5-10K) temperature range. The analysis of the CV characteristics /6/ and E\({}_{a}\)(\(\xi\)) dependences yield the mean trap densities N\({}_{t}\) and trapping depths \(\xi_{t}\) of the LB samples. At the vicinity of the Si(p) substrate dominate traps with mean depth E\({}_{t}\)-0.3-0.1 eV and N\({}_{t}\)=10\({}^{17}\)-10\({}^{18}\)cm\({}^{-3}\), while in the vicinity of the top evaporated electrode the trap depth equals 0.5-0.1eV with N_t^10^1810^19cm^3. The mean density of traps decreases with increasing thickness L of the LB film from N_t^(1-5)*10^19cm^3 (n-6) down to N_t^(2-7)*10^17cm^3(n-50).The structure of the E_t^(6) dependence (see Fig.2) indicates that the carrier traps possess a spatially non-uniform distribution. It may be suggested that the observed trapping states are of structural origin /6/.1 has been shown that the VOPhc monolayers possess an overall amorphous structure with inclusion of dispersive crystalline regions /a/.These crystallites,with more closely packed molecules,may serve as structural trapping centers both for electrons and holes /6/.1 it is noticeable that the dielectric breakdown fields in these LB films are very high and lie over \(\xi\)10^17 v/cm (see Fig.2 and 3).At high electric fields we observed an interesting reversible field effect. At a definite critical field the E_t^(8) value steeply decreases down to zero and the conductivity thus becomes quasi - "trap-free" (Fig.2).

In addition, we observed that the \(\mathcal{C}_{\text{c}}\)value is temperature dependent and decreases with decreasing T (see Fig.3). This reverse-sible effect may serve as evidence that at \(\mathcal{C}_{\text{c}}\)\(\mathcal{C}_{\text{b}}\)hot, non-thermalized charge carriers are created with mean drift velocity \(\nu_{\text{d}}\) greater than the mean thermal velocity \(\nu_{\text{th}}\) of the carrier. The effect of the high field induced hot carrier generation has been recently observed by Karl et al. /9/.1 in naphthalene and \(\delta\)-perylene crystals at low temperatures and by Bitterling and Willig/10/ in anthracene crystal at room temperature. The characteristic \(\mathcal{C}_{\text{b}}\)(T) dependence of hot carrier generation has been confirmed both experimentally and by computer simulation/11/.

3. Energy structure

The energy structure of_conduction(E_e.E_h^) and trapping (E_t^) levels of a VOPhc LB film are schematically shown on Fig.4. As may be seen, the VOPhc multi-layer assembly energetically forms a sequence of quantum wells, characteristic for superlattice structures. The conduction levels of the bilayer of semiconductor Phc molecules, with the energy gap E_t^2-1 eV, are seperated by the insulating layers of aliphatic "tails".

possessing an energy gap of ca.9 ev.Charge carrier transport from the conduction level of one potencial well to another takes place presumably by electron tunneling via the insulating layer of the aliphatic tails.The Fermi levels of the metallic electrodes are positioned close to the hole conduction level thus creating favourable condition for effective hole injection The energy gap E\({}_{q}\)=2.ev, charac-teristic for phthalocyanines, was determined from intrinsic photoconductivity spectral threshold, the ionization poten-tials I\({}_{c}\) from photoelectron emission spectra /12/.

A. Electron tunneling spectroscopy data

Inelastic electron tunneling spectra of an amphiphilic vOPhc monolayer were measured in a tunneling junction Al/Al\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)/ /vOPhc/pb deposited on a quartz substrate.The vibronic and electronic excitation bands were obtained by tunneling modulation technique at 4.2 K and plotted in d\({}^{2}\)/d\({}^{2}\) versus U coordi-nates.

The detailed description of the experiment and analysis of the results will be published elsewhere /13/.

In the spectral region of vibronic excitation two dominant bands were observed:the C-M stretching mode at =0.377 eV and the O-H stretching mode at 0.452 eV.The first band presumably is caused by inelastic scattering of tunneling electrons on C-H groups of the aliphatic chain, the second one may be due to scattering on the -OH groups at the surface of the Al\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) layer.

In the region of electronic excitation there emerge 4 distinct spectral bands: two bands caused by S\({}_{c}\)F\({}^{*}\)1 and S\({}_{q}\)S\({}^{*}\)1 transitions at 1.15 and 1.7 eV,respectively,a band at 0.70 eV, presumably due to Me-ligand transition,and a band at 1.4 eV which may be ascribed to a CT-transition.

Thus,in the subexciton spectral region the dominant inelastic scattering is due to the excitation of C-H vibrations of the aliphatic "tails".

2. Computer simulation data

Computer simulation approach has been successfully used for model description of charge carrier generation and transport processes in polyacene crystals /11,14,15/. However, in case of LB films all necessary experimental input data are not available for such simulation.

Fig.5. Calculated mean values of the charge carrier drift velocity V\({}_{d}\) as a function of electric field \(\xi\) ;T-300K; E\({}_{u}\) =1.3eV; m\({}_{eff}\)-1326m; \(\theta\)-7.4\(\times\)10\({}^{12}\) s\({}^{-1}\).

Nevertheless, some rough estimates can be obtained using analo-gous approaches to those of model description of carrier transport in molecular crystals. Fig.5 illustrates the calcula- ted v\({}_{d}\)(\(\xi\)) dependences for the VOPhc LB film (n=30; L=630A). The drift velocity field dependence v\({}_{d}\)(\(\xi\)) was taken according to ref./10/.

As may be seen from Fig.5,at field values \(\xi\)\(\sim\)\(\xi\)\({}_{c}\)" 1.1\(\cdot\)10\({}^{6}\)v/cm hot charge carriers actually can be created with v\({}_{d}\)(\(\xi\))\(>\) vth in accordance with experimental E\({}_{u}\)(\(\xi\)) - 0 curves (see Fig.3). On the other hand, a carrier injected at \(\xi\) -1.1\(\cdot\)10\({}^{6}\) v/cm, thermalizes at the mean thermalization distance r=46 A. obtaining a mean thermal velocity of v\({}_{th}\)-1.85\(\cdot\)10\({}^{5}\)cm/s. The estimated mean free path of hot carriers is field dependent 1(\(\xi\)) and equals ca. 37 A at \(\xi\) =1.2\(\cdot\)10\({}^{6}\)v/cm and ca. 8 A at \(\xi\)\(\sim\)5\(\cdot\)10\({}^{6}\)v/cm. The estimated time-of-flight t\({}_{tr}\) of a hot carrier across the LB film is of the order of several picoseconds and its value also decreases with growing field strength.
