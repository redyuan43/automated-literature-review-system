## I Introduction

With the recent development of GaN-based technology, blue laser diodes are emerging as a valuable optical source for several applications. They have demonstrated excellent performances in various topics such as displays, harmonic generation in the far-UVC and industrial metallurgical processes of highly reflective metals [1, 2, 3]. They are also of interest for laser surgery, with high performances in tissue vaporization and coagulation [4]. However, blue laser diodes and laser arrays fabrication technology is not as mature yet for beam combining applications, compared to near-IR diode arrays. Several studies have been conducted to enhance power, spatial brightness and spectral brightness. Non-coherent beam combining techniques like wavelength multiplexing and polarization multiplexing have shown improvements of spatial brightness in high-power blue lasers [5]. Other methods include filtered optical feedback that is provided by a diffraction grating in an external cavity [6, 7]. Using the latter method, we have recently shown several orders of magnitude improvement in the spectral brightness of blue laser diodes and blue laser arrays [8, 9]. In this work, we study phase locking of a large group of broad-area blue diodes on a 1D bar-array in an external V-shaped half-Talbot cavity made with surface grating in Littrow configuration [10]. To the best of our knowledge, coherent phase-locking of high-power broad-area blue diode laser array has not been reported so far. In our experiments, phase locking is confirmed by observing the far-field interference fringes and by contrasting them with the numerically calculated far-field beam profiles.

## II Experimental setup

Figure 1 shows the schematic design of the phase locking and coherent beam combining of a large group of emitters in ID array of broad-area laser diode (BALD) in an external half-Talbot cavity made with a surface grating in Littrow configuration. Blue laser array was manufactured by OSRAM. It contains 63 broad-area emitters. The emitter size (45 \(\mu\)m) is relatively small compared to the array pitch (150 \(\mu\)m), which adds an additional experimental challenge in coupling the diodes via back-reflected light from the external cavity. The laser array was coated with a very low AR coating (\(\leq\) 0.3%) on the emitting facets of the diodes and did not generate stimulated emission without optical feedback. The laser array is biased QCW with the pulse characteristics being 4% duty cycle and pulse width of 500 \(\mu\)s, and that corresponds to the repetition frequency of 80 Hz. The radiation from the laser diode array is collimated with an off-the-shelf fast-axis-correction (FAC) lens and is divided into two paths with a prism mirror (PM). In the feedback path, a pair of cylindrical lenses (CL1 and CL2) with a focal length of 150 mm collimates the laser beams along the slow axis direction and projects an image of the diode array at the focal plane of the CL2 lens. The grating was placed at a quarter Talbot distance (2.5 cm) from the focal plane of the CL2 lens. This means that the roundtrip cavity distance is the half-Talbot distance. This external cavity provides the filtered optical feedback to the laser diode array in a slightly off-axis configuration. This forces all the emitters to lase in a common wavelength with narrow spectral linewidth and induces the phenomenon of mutual phase locking. The output-path beam was collimated by a cylindrical lens (CL3) and subsequently divided into two optical branches with a ratio of 10% for the first branch and 90% for the second branch. The first branch is further attenuated and impinges the active area of a beam profiler that gives access to the far-field profile. The second branch is

either used for retrieving the optical power with a photopile or used to measure the beam quality factor M\({}^{2}\). In the latter case, a confocal pair of lenses (CL3 and CL4) with a focal length of 150 mm projects the near-field image of the lasers array at the focal plane of the CL4 lens. A slit is placed in the near-field image plane and selects an individual laser for analysis. The measured values of M\({}^{2}\) were used for the numerical simulation of the far-field beam profile.

## III Results and discussion

In the following, we discuss a configuration where filtered optical feedback from the grating allows 24 lasers to generate stimulated emission. Fig. 2 shows the simulated far-field profile (in green) that is obtained when combining the beams of 8 lasers emitting at 443 nm that are fully coherent. As the interference pattern shows a maximum for a far-field angle of 0 mrads, this means that the 8 lasers are in the in-phase configuration, meaning that the phase-shift between two adjacent emitters is 0. In addition, the interval between two interference peaks is given by \(\lambda\)/b, which is equal to 2.95 mrads as the wavelength of emission is \(\lambda\) = 443 nm and the pitch between lasers is b = 150 \(\mu\)m. The corresponding experimental far-field profile is displayed in red in Fig. 2 (reversed for clarity) and that corresponds to a peak power of 7.3 W. The experimental interference pattern clearly shows a maximum for a far-field angle of 0 mrads and an interval between peaks that is very close to the simulated value, as highlighted by the vertical dashed lines. However, the width of the experimental peaks is broader than that of the simulated peaks and this indicates on partial coherence between the emitters. Moreover, there is a wide background in the experimental case and that is another indication that the experimental configuration contains a combination of coherent, partially coherent, and incoherent lasers. By slightly tuning the grating in the external cavity, it is possible to transition from an in-phase configuration to an out-of-phase configuration. Figure 3 shows the latter configuration and the simulated far-field profile for 8 lasers is plotted in green. In that case, there is a destructive interference for a far-field angle of 0 mrads coming from the \(\pi\)-phase shift between adjacent emitters. The experimental curve is shown in red (reversed for clarity) and conclusions that were drawn for the in-phase configuration also apply to the out-of-phase configuration. The experimental optical peak power is 6.5 W for the out-of-phase configuration.

In summary, this work describes the first experimental demonstration of phase locking and coherent beam combining of a group of emitters in broad-area blue laser diodes bar and this was achieved due to filtered feedback provided by a grating in a half-Talbot cavity. The experimental characteristics of phase locking were compared to theoretical phase locking between perfectly coherent emitters, and this is an indication of partial coherence in our experiment. We believe that the main reason for not achieving higher level of coherence, in contrast to that reported in Ref. [10] for near-IR diodes, is related to the characteristics of diodes in the array. Indeed, near-field measurements confirmed that there is a very large spread in emission intensity of the diodes (of the order of 100%), possibly due to the variance of low AR coatings in the array we employed that degraded the quality of phase-locking. Yet, these efforts pave the way towards high-quality phase locking of broad-area blue laser diodes array to obtain high-power coherent blue emitters which would be ideal sources for directed energy and underwater applications.
