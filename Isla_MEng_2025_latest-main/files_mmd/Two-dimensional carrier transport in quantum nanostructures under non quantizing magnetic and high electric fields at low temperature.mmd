## 1 Introduction

There have been intensive attentions towards the GaN-based III-V semiconductors because of their potential application to optoelectronics [1]. The quality of cubic GaN crystal grown by metal organic vapour phase epitaxy has been improved and the features of this material have been observed. Due to commercial realization of high brightness blue and green LEDS, considerable progress has been made to elucidate the fundamental optical and electrical properties of InGaN based quantum well based structures. There have been many recent investigations on two-dimensional (2D) electron transport in quantum structures due to its important from physical and application point of view. A clear picture about the different scattering mechanisms controlling the carrier dynamics in the structures and bond details can be obtained from the studies of the galvanomagnetic transport coefficients. Different work on carrier transport has been extensively studied in the absences of a magnetic field [2] and in the presence of a quantizing magnetic field. The transport coefficients are greatly influence in the presence of high magnetic field. Shubrikov de has oscillation and magnetophenon effect is observed under applications of a high field as energy spectrum is splitted into a set of Landon levels. Magnetoresistance under high magnetic field and electric field has been computed by several researchers. From the above studies it appear that the investigation of the carrier transport properties of 2D electron are mostly confined to high (quantizing) magnetic fields. However, the similar investigations for a high electric field and a cross low nonquantizing magnetic field are scare in the literature. Hence the present work depicts the calculations of the two-dimensional hot electron galvanomagnatic transport coefficients, namely: the magneto resistance coefficient, the Hall mobility, the Hall-to-drift mobility ratio under non-quantizing magnetic fields and high electric fields in a GaN QW for lattice temperatures in then range of 4-25 K incorporating relevant scattering mechanisms and heated Fermi-Dirac distribution function.

## 2 Analytical Model

In the present work, a GaN square quantum well of infinite barrier height is considered. This approximation is valid because the bond off set between the well and the barrier layers is more than three times the average electron energy in the well for the highest dc electron field considered. The electrons therefore, assumed to populate the lowest sub-band of the square quantum well (QW) in the infinite barrier height approximation. Carrier scatterings via ionized impurities and deformation potential acoustic phonons are considered here in the calculations. Screened scattering rates are considered. The effect of remote impurity scattering can be further reduced substantially by introducing thick spacer layer. Again, the effect of piezoelectric scattering is always one order lower in magnitude. Hence they are not considering in the calculations. Bulk mode phonon model is incorporated in the present work in order to avoid complexity in calculations. But it has been observed that inclusion of such concept does not incorporate any significant error in the results. In fact, calculations of ohmic mobility with bulk mode phonons agree with experimental results for (In,Ga)As nanostructures. In view of the above considerations, here we employ bulk mode phonons to avoid considerably complicated expressions of the scattering rates for the full phonon structures without sacrificing greatly the accuracy of the results.

Let us consider the \(Z\)-axis perpendicular to the interfacial planes in the rectangular Cartesian coordinate system and the carriers are free to move parallel to the xy plane. The heating electric field F and the classical magnetic field B are assumed to act along the x-axis, respectively. The electron-electron interaction is much stronger in QW due to modulation doping and an electron temperature is established as evident from photo luminance experiment [3.68]. The electron temperature Te and the heating electric field are coupled through the energy balance equation depicted as:\[f\,E\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}\right)_{\beta\in dd}d\vec{k}+f\,E\left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial t}\right)_{coll}d\vec{k}=0 \tag{1}\]

\(\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}\right)_{coll}\)\(<\)011, Called the inelastic screened deformation potential acoustic scattering, is determined from the square of the relevant matrix element for the 2D systems using the similar method as used in case of bulk materials. As the acoustic phonon energy \(\hbar wq\) is much less than the carrier energy \(E\),\(f_{0}(E+\hbar\omega q)\) is expanded as a Taylor series and the terms with power of \(\hbar\omega q\) higher than two are neglected. Perturbation function \(\xi_{\mathrm{x}}(E)\) are then calculated with the help of Boltzmann's transport equation and expressed as:

\[\xi_{x}\left(E\right)= \frac{\Gamma\left(E\right)}{\left[1+\left(\omega_{g}\,\Gamma \left(E\right)\right)^{2}\right]} \tag{2}\] \[\xi_{x}\left(E\right)= \frac{\Gamma^{2}\left(E\right)}{\left[1+\left(\omega_{g}\,\Gamma \left(E\right)\right)^{2}\right]} \tag{3}\]

Here \(\xi_{\mathrm{x}}(E)\) is the momentum relaxation time and given by

\[\frac{1}{\Gamma\left(E\right)}=\frac{1}{\Gamma_{\mathrm{x}}}+\frac{1}{\Gamma _{\mathrm{imp}}\left(E\right)} \tag{4}\]

Where \(\Gamma_{\mathrm{imp}}(E)\) and \(\Gamma_{\mathrm{ac}}(E)\) are the momentum relaxation times for ionized impurity and acoustic deformation, respectively. The detailed expressions for \(\Gamma_{\mathrm{imp}}(E)\) and \(\Gamma_{\mathrm{ac}}(E)\) taken from ref (3). The Hall mobility (\(\mu_{H}\)), the magneto resistance coefficient (\(R_{m}\)), and Hall ratio (\(r_{H}\)) are calculated and expressed them as :

\[\mu_{H}=\frac{\left|\mu_{xy}\right|\left(\mu_{xx}\left(0\right)\right)}{\left[ \mu_{xx}^{2}+\mu_{xy}^{2}\right]B} \tag{5}\]

\[R_{m}=\frac{\mu_{H}}{\left|\mu_{xy}\right|}\frac{B\,\mu_{xx}}{\left|\mu_{xy} \right|}-1 \tag{6}\]

\[\mathrm{and}\quad r_{H}=\frac{\mu_{H}}{\mu_{xx}\left(0\right)} \tag{7}\]

\[\mathrm{here,}\quad\mu_{xy}= \left(\frac{e\omega_{g}}{\pi h^{2}n_{2D}}\right)_{0}^{m}\left[ \begin{matrix}\omega\\ 0\end{matrix}-\frac{\left(\frac{\partial f_{0}}{\partial E}\right)}{1+\left[ \omega_{g}\,\Gamma\left(E\right)\right]^{2}}\,EdE \tag{8}\]

\[\mu_{xx}= \left(\frac{e\omega_{g}}{\pi h^{2}n_{2D}}\right)_{0}^{m}\left[ \begin{matrix}\omega\\ 0\end{matrix}-\frac{\left(\frac{\partial f_{0}}{\partial E}\right)}{\delta E \left(E\right)}\frac{\xi\,\left(E\right)}{1+\left[\omega_{g}\,\Gamma\left(E \right)\right]^{2}}\,EdE \tag{9}\]

and \(\mu_{\mathrm{xx}}(0)\) is the value of \(\mu_{\mathrm{xx}}\) for magnetic field B=0.

## 3 Result And Discussions

Numerical results are obtained for a GaN QW at lattice temperatures of 10,20 and 30K with the material parameters given in ref.3. A typical value of 6 \(\times\) 10\({}^{21}\)m\({}^{-3}\) for the background ionized impurity concentration (\(n_{\mathrm{h}b}\)) is used in the present calculations. The non-quantizing magnetic field is B for which \(\hbar n_{\mathrm{OB}}\) is much less than the average energy of the electron (at least one order less is the present case). The Hall mobility (\(\mu_{H}\)) decreases and magnetoresistance with increasing channel length (L\({}_{\mathrm{z}}\)) as shown in the Fig1 for a nonquantizing magnetic field B=0.001T, 2D carrier concentration \(n_{\mathrm{2D}}=6\)\(\times\) 10\({}^{-15}\)m\({}^{-2}\), electric field of 500v/m at lattice temperatures of 10,20 and 30K. This variation is associated with the fact that as \(L_{z}\) increases, the phonon scattering become weaker and the impurity scattering gets stronger. The decreases of \(\mu_{\mathrm{H}}\) with \(L_{z}\) are less significant compared to the extent of increase of \(R_{m}\) with \(L_{z}\).
