## I Introduction

Fiber-fed distributed antenna systems(DAS) are very attractive due to the advantages offered by the fiber such as low loss, high bandwidth and interference free RF signal transmission. To implement the DAS in a cost-effective manner, Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers(VCSELs) and multi-mode fibers(MMFs) can be used. In [1] it has been demonstrated that VCSELs can have excellent linearity performance, close to that of distributed feedback(DFB) and Fabry-Perot lasers. High signal quality was reported in [2, 3] while transmitting WLAN, GSM-1800 and WCDMA signals over MMFs using VCSELs.

While the use of MMFs and VCSELs provide important cost reductions, to make the complete system cost-effective, RAUs must also be made low cost. The use of a standard CMOS technology enables both low cost and compact size through high integration, but the performance of CMOS photodiodes is a major bottleneck. In [4], however, an avalanche photodiode (APD) manufactured in 180 nm CMOS technology is used in an RAU to receive WLAN signals, and in [5] a circuit in 0.25 um BiCMOS technology is demonstrated for 60 GHz wireless links also using an APD. While APDs offer high bandwidth and responsivity, they unfortunately require very high reverse bias voltage (>10V). The nominal supply voltage in a 65nm CMOS technology is just 1.2 V, so the reliability of APDs in such a process under high reverse bias voltage is still to be investigated. Furthermore APDs tend to generate excess noise due to their random amplification process.

Fig. 1 shows the block diagram of the low cost and fully integrated RAU intended for fiber-fed distributed antenna systems. We used a standard n-well/p-sub photodiode instead of an APD. The \(-\)3 dB bandwidth of such a photodiode in 65 nm CMOS technology is just 6 MHz with a roll-off of about 5\(-\)6 dB/decade [6]. We take advantage of this slow roll-off and distribute the signal at an intermediate frequency (IF), here 100 MHz, and perform the frequency up-conversion inside the RAU. Although it increases the complexity of the RAU, there are several advantages with this approach compared to distribution directly at RF. The sensitivity of the RAU will be 7\(-\)8 dB higher when using a standard CMOS photodiode. Furthermore, the loss in the MMF will be lower for signal distribution at IF. It has also been shown in literature [2] that for analog signal transmission over MMF, the EVM performance of the link is directly related to the fiber bandwidth (MHz-km), which means that for a given EVM requirement an IF link can be much longer than an RF link.

Together with the modulated signal a reference signal for the frequency synthesizer is also transmitted over the fiber. In the RAU the frequency reference signal is separated from the modulated signal by appropriate filtering. It is then used by the frequency synthesizer to generate the local oscillator (LO) signal for the mixers. All RAUs present in the DAS can now be locked to the same frequency reference, which is important to the performance of a multi-antenna system. The up-converted signal is further amplified by an off-chip power amplifier.

In this letter, as an initial step, we demonstrate a radio-fiber interface circuit which will be part of the fully integrated RAU shown in Fig. 1. In this design a 131.25 MHz electrical reference signal is used for the PLL instead of being fed through the fiber. The circuit is manufactured using standard ST Microelectronics 65 nm CMOS process and occupies just 0.8 mm\({}^{2}\) of chip area, including bondpads.

## II Implementation

The block diagram of the radio-fiber interface circuit together with the manufactured chip microphotograph is shown in Fig. 2. A standard n-well/p-substrate photodiode with 29 n-well fingers was designed, the width of each finger being 1.5 um. The diameter of the photodiode is 60 um suitable for receiving light from the MMF. The simulated parasitic capacitance is 1.5 pF at 1.2 V reverse bias. The photodiode has a measured DC responsivity of 0.121 A/W, while the \(-\)3 dB frequency is only 6 MHz [6]. The frequency response of the photodiode, however, rolls off quite slowly (5\(-\)6 dB/decade), making it usable at frequencies upto several hundred MHz. The responsivity of the photodiode at 100 MHz is 0.040 A/W. The photodiode is ac-coupled to the transimpedance amplifier (TIA), which is based on a shunt-shunt feedback topology, where the transimpedance is set by a feedback resistor of 8 k\(\Omega\). A three stage topology is used to implement the inverting amplifier. A cascade amplifier is used in the first stage to reduce the Miller effect, and the other two stages are common source amplifiers with resistive loads. The simulated bandwidth of the TIA exceeds 500 MHz. The single-ended signal from the TIA is converted to differential by an active balun, implemented as a resistively loaded common source amplifier with resistive source degeneration, where the input is applied at the gate and output is taken from the source and drain terminals.

For single-sideband (SSB) up-conversion quadrature phases are needed for both the IF and LO signals. The IF signal is converted to quadrature by using a passive poly-phase filter (PPF). The required bandwidth over which high image rejection is required is about 20 MHz, centered at 100 MHz, so a three stage stagger-tuned PPF filter was designed. Capacitors of 500 fF were used in all stages, while the resistance was increased going from the input stage to the output. The signals after the PPF are amplified to compensate for the filter losses. A passive voltage mode mixer driven by 25% duty cycle LO signals is used for frequency up-conversion [7]. The size of the switch transistors was optimized for low noise and limited power consumption in the LO buffer. The pre-PA was implemented as an open drain differential cascode amplifier driving the external 50 \(\Omega\) load and its bias was provided through an external bias-Tee.

An on-chip integer-N phase locked loop (PLL) is used to generate a 4.2 GHz signal, which is further divided by two in the LO generator to create the quadrature LO signals with 25% duty cycle required by the mixer. The PLL consists of a phase frequency detector (PFD), charge pump, loop filter, LC voltage controlled oscillator (VCO), and a frequency divider. The bandwidth of the PLL is about 500 kHz. The mixer switches are driven by an LO buffer.

## III Measurements

The chip was directly glued on an FR-4 printed circuit board (PCB) and all signals were wire-bonded. All losses were carefully de-embedded, except for the PCB losses that are included in the measurement results. A supply voltage of 1.2 V was used for the entire chip except the pre-PA, which used 1.8 V. The photodiode reverse bias was set to 1.2 V. The total power consumption was 89 mW, of which the pre-PA consumed 65 mW. The PLL consumed 8.6 mW, whereas the LO generator and LO buffer consumed 4.8 mW and 4 mW, respectively, and the TIA, active balun and PPF consumed 6.6 mW. The optical measurement setup is shown in Fig. 3, where the light from a Finisar VCSEL (HFE4192-581) was coupled into a 2 meter long MMF with a core diameter of 50 um. A dual lens focused from OZ Optics was used to focus the light onto the chip. The focused creates a spot-size of about 50 um at 4.3 mm working distance. The laser was modulated directly by a signal generator (R&S SMIQ 06B) and DC bias current was fed using a bias-Tee. The peak to peak optical power(W\({}_{pk-pk}\)) at the output of the fiber was deduced by measuring the DC optical power around the operating point of the laser using a power meter, where the bias was changed according to the modulation voltage. The optical power was calculated as 10 \(\times\) log(1000 \(\times\) 0.5 \(\times\) W\({}_{pk-pk}\)). Insertion loss in the focused (0.2 dB) was neglected. The electrical output signal was measured using a spectrum analyzer (R&S FSU).

Fig. 4 shows the measured single tone transmission test result. At 5 dBm output power, LO leakage is about \(-40\) dBc and the image is \(-43\) dBc. The image rejection ratio of \(43\) dB means a quadrature accuracy of better than \(1^{\circ}\) and \(1\%\) in phase and amplitude, respectively. The measured electrical output power versus input optical power is plotted in Fig. 5. The output referred 1 dB compression point is about 6 dBm and optical to electrical (O/E) conversion gain is 59 dB (V/W). The laser has a specified average optical power of \(-4\) dBm and it can be seen that output power start to compress at the same input level.

The measured input referred current noise is \(3.5\)pA/\(\sqrt{\text{Hz}}\). A two tone test with a tone spacing of \(5\) MHz was performed to measure the linearity. At an average output power of \(3.3\) dBm, the third order inter-modulation products (IM3) are 33 dB below the fundamental tones, which corresponds to an output referred third order intercept point (OIP3) of \(+17\) dBm. When a \(4.5\) dB optical attenuator was used at the output of the laser, the difference between the fundamental and third order intermodulation products (IM3) increased by 16 dB instead of the ideal 18 dB, which means that at this input power level, the IM3 slope is not 3 dB/dB. However, we can conclude that the non-linearities of the VCSEL are not dominant. The spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) of the circuit is \(96.5\) dB\(\cdot\)Hz\({}^{2/3}\). Furthermore, adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR) was measured by applying modulated signals. The circuit was tested with a Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) modulated signal having peak to average power ratio (PAPR) of 5.8 dB and a Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (32 QAM) signal with a PAPR of 6.9 dB. Fig. 6(a) shows the measured spectrum with QPSK modulated signal, which has an ACLR of \(-41\) dB at an average output power of \(4\) dBm, where the signal bandwidth is \(3.84\) MHz and the channel bandwidth is \(5\) MHz. Fig. 6(b) shows the output spectrum with the 32 QAM signal having an ACLR of \(-39\) dB at an average power of \(1\) dBm, where the signal bandwidth is \(10\) MHz and the channel bandwidth is \(14\) MHz. The measured phase noise of the PLL is \(-110\) dBc/Hz and \(-145\) dBc/Hz at \(1\) MHz and \(20\) MHz offset, respectively. The reference spur level at the PLL output was \(-58\) dBc. The phase noise and spurs were measured at \(4.2\) GHz so the actual phase noise performance at \(2.1\) GHz is expected to be 6 dB better after division by 2.

## IV Conclusion

We have presented a CMOS integrated radio-fiber interface circuit targeted towards low cost RAUs for RoF links based on VCSELs and MMFs. To circumvent the limited bandwidth of CMOS photodiodes and the relatively high attenuation in the MMF at high frequencies, signals modulated on a \(100\) MHz carrier are transmitted over the fiber and converted to radio frequency inside the RAU. The measured results indicate that this approach has a great potential for realizing low cost remote antenna units, and future work will focus on realizing the entire RAU on a CMOS chip.
