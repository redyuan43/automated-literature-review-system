## I Introduction

As the epitaxial growth of semiconductor materials, device technology and packaging technology, high power semiconductor lasers as compact and highly efficient light emitting source, have found wide application [1]. High-power Semiconductor lasers or laser diode (LD) are commonly used edge-emitting strip structure. Because the width of the emitter is much larger than the height of the emitter, the cross section of the beam is elliptical. The cone of light has a different divergence in the dimension perpendicular to the junction ('fast axis') than that in the dimension parallel to the junction ('slow axis'). The beam divergence angle is about 30\({}^{\circ}\)-60\({}^{\circ}\)along 'fast axis' and 8\({}^{\circ}\)-12\({}^{\circ}\) along'slow axis'. In practical applications, the beam from a laser diode must be shaped or coupled into the fiber output. The technology of fiber-coupled has become a research hotspot. Now the fiber-coupled technology with laser diode arrays is relatively developed, high-power laser diode fiber-coupled module has been commercialize [2][1]. But such fiber-coupled module is relatively complex, the module cost is higher. In addition, the laser diode array with a greater operating current is not conducive to miniaturization of the system, these have limited high-power laser diode fiber-coupled module applications. In recent years, a series multi-LD beam fiber-coupled scheme has been developed. This scheme has such advantages as simple optical manufacturing process, easy adjusting and low cost, smaller operating current, holds very broad application prospects in many fields including industry, commercial and military fields.

In this paper, a novel series multi-LD beam fiber-coupled scheme has been developed, which uses a concave mirror to combine LD beams. First, the output beam from a laser diode is collimated by a column lens. Then, the collimated beam are rearranged by the plane mirror and concave mirrors in space and coupled into the optical fiber by a non-spherical lens. Based on this scheme, practical fiber-coupled module of laser diodes in series have been designed, assembled and tested. The fiber-coupled module with a compact structure, simplified optical construction, high-brightness output, can be widely used in medical, laser marking, material handling and other fields [4].

## II Principle

According to the principle of geometrical optics, the two ideal conjugate point of concave spherical mirror are overlap in the center of the sphere. When a light source placed in the center of a concave spherical mirror, the light reflected by the spherical mirror has converged to the Globe. Similarly a light source S with divergence angle \(\theta\) is placed near the mirror axis, light reflected by the spherical mirror converge to the point S', as shown in Figure 1.

Laser diode emitted beam is very asymmetric along horizontal and vertical directions, divergence angle larger along fast axis. In order to avoid beam transmission losses, reduce geometric dimensions of optical system, a micro-cylindrical lens is installed before the laser diode light-emitting area parallel to the direction of p

Figure 1: a light source is reflected by concave spherical mirrorcollimated along fast axis [5]. After collimation, the divergence angle is unchanged along slow-axis and decreases along fast-axis. The beam can be approximately considered as a line source. Suppose N line source parallel to each other and closely arranged in point S, the appropriate choice of the radius of concave spherical mirrors, adjusting the distance between the light source S and the spherical mirror M will enable light S converge on S'. When fiber end be placed at S', light can be coupled into fiber. Figure 2 is schematic diagram.

In the actual structure, it is difficult to achieve N light tightly arranged in a point, so N plane mirrors insert in light way, by adjusting the angle of plane mirrors to achieve a light source N tightly arranged. In addition, in order to reduce the light spot size to meet the requirements of fiber-coupled, a focusing lens is inserted. Optimized design allows focusing lens to be the focus of the size and divergence angle less than the fiber core diameter and numerical aperture. Figure 3 is the diagram of multi-beam fiber-coupled module by concave mirror. N laser diodes LD1...... LDn are place in ladder-shaped, the laser diode beam is collimated by collimating cylindrical lens 2, a beam divergence angle is compressed along "fast axis", collimated beam is reflected to concave mirror 4 by mirror 3, concave mirror 4 compress "slow-axis" divergence angle and converge beams into the lens 5, lens 5 focus beams into fiber end face. By adjusting the location and angle of the plane mirror correspond to the laser diodes LD1... LDn, the beam of laser diodes is coupled into a multi-mode fiber.

## III **The module design and assembly processes**

In order to achieve the above design idea, the module structure is design and processing, Figure 4 is the designed module structure diagram. LD units with the fast axis collimation are installed on fixed platforms, between the platform and the shell insert in TEC. Heat generated by the LD is rapidly transferred to the shell and distributed out, to prevent the junction temperature rise and the laser diode failure. In order to reduce thermal resistance, double-sided metallization TEC is used, the platform, TEC and the shell are welded connection by low-temperature solder Pb / Sn / Bi (melting point of 110 \({}^{\circ}\) C). The cylindrical lens has been replaced by a multi-mode fiber, used for the output beam collimating, concave mirror and plane mirror surfaces are coated high-performance reflective dielectric film (at a wavelength of 800nm-1000nm, the reflectivity greater than 99.9%). Coupling lens with hemispherical lens, the focal length f = 1.5mm, are coated high-performance anti-reflective films. Fiber core diameter is 100\(\upmu\)m, numerical aperture is 0.22.

In order to reduce the module's operating current, LDs is in series connection, LD must be insulated between them. A transition heat sink is inserted between laser diode and Cu heat sink. The transition heat sink materials must have a high thermal conductivity coefficient and thermal expansion coefficient of matching to LD material. In the microelectronic device packaging process, packaging materials with high thermal conductivity are mainly Al\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\), BeO, BN, SiC, AlN, and diamond films and so on [6]. Diamond has a very high thermal conductivity, but its thermal expansion coefficient does not match with LD material (GaAs thermal expansion coefficient of 5.9), it is not suitable to use it as a transitional heat sink; the thermal expansion coefficient of Al\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) match with GaAs, but its thermal conductivity is low, it is not suitable to use it as a transitional heat sink too, while the AlN has high thermal conductivity, match with LD materials in thermal expansion coefficient, it is suitable to use AlN as a transitional heat sink. The package structure with a transitional heat sink AlN is shown in Figure 5. In order to reduce the phenomenon of indium migration which happens in the sintering process to avoid LD short-circuit, taking into account the compatibility of welding process, AuSn solder (80% Au, 20% Sn, melting point 280 \({}^{\circ}\)C) is used between chip and AlN transition heat sink, In solder (melting point 157 \({}^{\circ}\)C) is used between AlN transition heat sink and the C-mount.

Experiment and Analysis

To demonstrate the fiber-coupled scheme, a practical fiber-coupled module have been designed, packaged and tested. The module consists of six laser diodes, the wavelength of LD is 980nm and the width of a stripe is 100um. The fiber have 100um diameter core. The numerical aperture (NA) is 0.22. Figure.5 shows a photo of LD module. Figure.6 shows the test results of the comparison of P-I properties of the fiber-coupled output with the laser diode output. The fiber output power of 11.8W at current 3.0A has been obtained, with the total coupling efficiency of 75%. Because overall package thermal resistance of the module is smaller, the module can operate continuously in cooling conditions.

## V Conclusion

In summary, the series multi-LD beam fiber-coupled scheme, which uses a concave mirror, is a better way to achieve coupling high-power laser diodes into fiber. The beam of more than laser diode output coupled into the smaller core diameter fiber by this scheme. Fiber-coupled high power laser diode modules are the indispensable laser sources in solid-state laser pumping, fiber laser pumping, materials processing, laser medicine, space laser communication and military, owning to the excellent beam quality, high brightness and convenience in handling of the modules.
