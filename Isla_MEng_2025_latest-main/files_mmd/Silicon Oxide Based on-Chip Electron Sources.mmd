On-chip electron sources driven by electricity have been pursued by researchers for more than 60 years for their light in mass, compactness, being integratable, high energy-efficiency and fast response, etc. Thought many efforts have been devoted to them, the results are still unsatisfactory. Recently, we have proposed a new type of on-chip electron source based on electroformed silicon oxide between graphene films on silicon oxide[1], which is named electron-emitting nanod diode (EEND). Electron emission from our devices is thought to be generated from horizontal tunneling diodes formed in electroformed silicon oxide. The EEND can be turned on by a voltage of \(\sim\)7 V in \(\sim\)100 ns and show an emission current of up to several microamperes, corresponding to an emission density of \(\sim\)10\({}^{6}\) A/cm\({}^{2}\) and emission efficiency as high as 16.6%. Since using semiconductor fabrication technology makes its fabrication very easy, an array of 100 EENDs is fabricated in an effective area of 82 \(\upmu\)m \(\times\) 18 \(\upmu\)m and its emission current reaches 73.4 \(\upmu\)A, which exhibits a global emission density of 5 A/cm\({}^{2}\) and stable emission with negligible current degradation over tens of hours under a vacuum of \(\sim\)5\(\times\)10\({}^{6}\) Pa. Recent experiments show emission current increases linearly with the numbers of EENDs in an array, and emission current has reached to 1 mA. Combined advantages of high emission current and density, high emission efficiency, low working voltage, and easy fabrication make our on-chip electron sources promising in realizing miniature and on-chip electronic devices and systems based on free electron beams.
