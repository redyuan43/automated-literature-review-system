###### Abstract

UWB MIMO with four elements antenna is introduced in this paper. The asymmetric coplanar strip (ACS) is used to feed the MIMO antenna. The single antenna element consists of quarter elliptical ring radiator. The proposed antenna has size of (\(6\times 5\)) cm\({}^{2}\). The distance between the edge to edge points of the antenna elements equals \(0.37\,\lambda_{o}\) between antenna 1 and 2 and 0.14 between antenna 1 and 3 at 3 GHz. The proposed MIMO antenna is across the 3 GHz to 10.6 GHz bandwidth with a reflection coefficient lower than -10 dB. Also, the insertion loss lower than 18 dB. The envelope correlation coefficient is calculated to evaluate MIMO performance.

## I Introduction

MIMO systems have several advantageous such as enhancing multipath fading and channel capacity of the wireless systems [1]-[2]. The UWB technology is approved to work from 3.1 to 10.6 GHz [3]. UWB technology has high data rates, low power level and low cost. Because of these advantageous researchers are encouraged to design antennas to active the UWB requirements [4-5].The challenge in designing MIMO antennas is increasing the isolation between antenna elements. The typical distance between the antenna elements should equal half-wavelength at the lowest operating frequency of UWB band. But this distance is very large as compared to the portable devices applications. So, several techniques are used to improve the isolation between the antenna elements [1],[6]. In this paper, a compact four elements UWB MIMO antenna with ACS-fed is presented. The single element antenna is composed of quarter elliptical ring radiator.The MIMO antenna performance has been checked using the commercial software CST microwave studio.

## II ACS-fed UWB Antenna Design

Fig. 1 illustrates the 2-D layout of the single element antenna. The antenna is composed of semi elliptical shape radiator with ACS fed with strip width = 3 mm and gap = 0.3 mm. The FR4 substrate has permittivity = 4.4 and thickness = 1.6 mm is utilized. The measured and simulated results of the single element ACS-fed UWB antenna are shown in Fig. 2 where (1) the antenna is working from 3.1
