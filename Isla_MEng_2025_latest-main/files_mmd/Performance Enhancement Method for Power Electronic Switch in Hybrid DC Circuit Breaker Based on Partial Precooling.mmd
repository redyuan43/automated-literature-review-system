## I Introduction

Hybrid circuit breakers (HCBs), which combine mechanical and power electronic switches, are becoming increasingly used in dc systems. It not only has obvious breaking reliability, but also has a flexible fast recolosing function and very low conduction loss when compared to other types of circuit breakers [1, 2, 3].

As shown in Fig. 1(a), the main structure of the HCB consists of 3 parts. The mechanical switch conducts load current in the on-state of HCB. When a fault occurs, the mechanical switch separates, and the fault current is forced to commutate to power the electronic switch in a specific way (usually a load commutation switch, which is omitted in the figure). The power electronic switch then continues to conduct current until the distance between the mechanical switch contacts is sufficient to tolerate overvoltage. Finally, the power electronic switch cuts orr the current via the internal fully controlled device, causing the fault current strike the metal oxide varistor (MOV), and the current begins to drop [4, 5].

It can be seen that the power electronic switch plays a vital role in achieving the current breaking function of HCB. The power electronic switch must be capable of controlling fault currents several times the rated value, necessitating the use of numerous large-capacity power electronic devices, resulting in expensive costs.

The insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) is currently the most widely used device in HCBs due to its superior turn-off capability. In addition, as shown in Fig. 1(b), the circuit breaker's single breaking condition makes it easy to create soft switching via an resistor-capacitor-diode (RCD) circuit, allowing the IGBT's instantaneous turn-off power to be reduced to a very

low level. As a result, obtaining the required turn-off capability is straightforward. Several literatures have claimed that devices with rated currents of 3 kA can achieve a pulse turn-off capability of around 30 kA for dc breaker applications [6, 7, 8].

In fact, rather than its turn-off capability, the power device's surge capability is the most crucial limiting element in its overall performance in HCBs. As shown in Fig. 1(c) and (d), before the turning off, the power electronic switch must sustain the fault current for about 2-3 ms, which is necessary for the mechanical switch to have the insulating capability. During this time, the device's junction temperature will rapidly rise due to on-state loss heating caused by a current that much exceeds the device's rated value. Moreover, since any external heat dissipation techniques (water cooling or air cooling) are nearly worthless on such a short time scale, the thermal capacitance effect of the device packaging and the heat sink will play the primary role, and the device's junction temperature will rapidly rise. Therefore, the temperature range between ambient temperature and maximum junction temperature has a direct impact on the power device's current capacity.

Unfortunately, both the maximum junction temperature and the ambient temperature are difficult to change. The former is an inherent feature of semiconductors, and the latter necessitates the use of expensive cooling equipment. Therefore, there is currently no ways to improve the performance of the devices in HCBs from the aspect of heat dissipation.

In such cases where conventional heat dissipation does not work, this letter proposes a new and alternative technological route which can "predissipate the transient heat" by reducing the initial temperature. The thermoelectric cooling technique [9] is applied to the high-power IGBTs for the first time. Due to the particular no-loss working condition of the power electronic switch of HCB in static state, a modest amount of cooling power is sufficient to accomplish a considerable temperature reduction in the nearby area of IGBTs before the HCB operates, hence improving power devices' surge performance. The method exploration and prototype development are presented in Section II and Section III, respectively, and the cost effectiveness of the precooling method is discussed in Section IV.

## II Proposed Performance Enhancement Method Based on Partial Precooling

### _Partial Precooling of Power Electronic Switch in HCB_

Fig. 2 shows the proposed partial precooling based power electronic device performance enhancement method. The thermoelectric cooling unit is shown in Fig. 2(a). It is made up of a sequence of P-type and N-type semiconductors in the center, as well as insulated heat guidance ceramics on both sides (the hot end on the left and the cold end on the right). When it is powered up, a temperature difference between the two ceramic end plates can be created. This thermoelectric cooling technique is compact in size, low in cost, and has no moving components, making it highly reliable when compared to other cooling systems.

Certainly, the thermoelectric cooling also has some shortcomings, such as insufficient insulation capacity, separate power supply requirement, and low cooling efficiency. In particular, the large amount of heat generation caused by the low cooling efficiency makes it basically impossible to use in conventional power electronic converters that require long-term heat dissipation. However, all these flaws can be solved or avoided in the hybrid circuit breaker. The reasons are as follows.

First, for the power supply problem, the IGBT drive units in HCB have already been equipped with a complete multioupt isolated power supply system [10], which can provide tens of watts of power to each unit. As a result, by following the existing isolated power supply system scheme and designing additional output power of each unit, the cooling unit can be directly put on the cathode heat sink of each IGBT [as shown in Fig. 2(b)], and share the same power unit with the IGBT's driver. Then, the problem of isolated power supply under high potential can be solved well. In fact, for the isolated power supply system, the transmission capacity is much easier to increase compared to the isolation voltage, so the additional power demand from the cooling unit has a low impact on the overall cost.

Then, the low efficiency problem of thermoelectric cooling is not significant in HCB applications. Since the mechanical switch carries the long-term operating current of the HCB in the on-state, the power electronic part is actually in the state

of zero voltage and zero current, and there is no heating. Thus, the cooling unit only need to provide very low cooling power (to offset the heat absorption power of metal components from the environment) to maintain the low temperature of the IGBTs' heat sink. Therefore, the issue of low efficiency can be neglected.

It should also be noted that the cooling unit does not need to cool the entire circuit breaker, and the area to be cooled should be limited to the vicinity of the IGBTs to save power. In fact, the connecting busbar between the heat sink and the snubber circuits generally has poor heat transfer, and the necessary thermal insulation coating also needs to be added to the heat sink.

### _Performance Enhancement Effect of Precooling_

When cooling technology is realized, its performance enhancement effect on power electronic devices is obvious. As shown in Fig. 2(c), the junction temperature of the power electronic switch employing the cooling unit is lower than the ambient temperature before the circuit breaker operates, allowing for additional temperature rise when subjected to surge current.

Assuming that the dynamic thermal resistance \(Z_{th}(t)\) of the power electronic device is known as

\[Z_{th}\ \left(t\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}R_{thi}\left(1-e^{-\frac{t}{\tau_{i}}}\right) \tag{1}\]

the temperature rise \(\Delta T(t)\) under arbitrary power excitation can be obtained by convolution of the instantaneous power loss \(P(t)\) and the derivative of \(Z_{th}(t)\) as follow:

\[\Delta T\ \left(t\right)=P\left(t\right)*\frac{\mathrm{d}Z_{th}\left(t\right)}{ \mathrm{d}t}=\int_{0}^{t}P\left(x\right)\cdot\frac{\mathrm{d}Z_{th}\left(t-x \right)}{\mathrm{d}t}\mathrm{d}x. \tag{2}\]

At high current, the power loss of IGBT can be approximately expressed as \(r_{\mathrm{eq}}\)-\(i^{2}\)(t), which is proportional to the square of the current. Furthermore, if the currents of various magnitudes flowing through the device in the circuit breaker are all assumed to be linear, the convolution in (2) can also be seen as proportional to the square of the maximum current, which is

\[\Delta T\propto I_{\mathrm{max}}^{2}. \tag{3}\]

Therefore, the current boosting ratio \(\frac{\Delta I_{\mathrm{max}}}{f_{\mathrm{max}}}\) corresponding to the temperature drop \(\Delta K\) of precooling is

\[\frac{\Delta I_{\mathrm{max}}}{I_{\mathrm{max}}}=\sqrt{\frac{\Delta T+ \Delta K}{\Delta T}}\ -1 \tag{4}\]

where \(\Delta T\ =T_{\mathrm{jmax}}\ -T_{\mathrm{ambient}}\) represents the allowable temperature rise range. Taking the Zhangbei project in China as an example, the dc circuit breakers and the converter valves are located in the same valve hall, where the maximum ambient temperature is 50 \({}^{\circ}\)C, so the allowable temperature rise range for the IGBT in circuit breaker is 50 \({}^{\circ}\)C-120 \({}^{\circ}\)C (considering some margins). On this premise, every 1 \({}^{\circ}\)C of initial temperature lowered by the precooling technique can increase the maximum current capability of the IGBT by around 0.7%. Fig. 3 also shows the current boosting ratio under different conditions (\(T_{\mathrm{jmax}}=120\ ^{\circ}\)C). It can be seen that the current boosting ratio will increase with the increase temperature drop \(\Delta K\), but also decreases with the decrease of ambient temperature The simulation result utilizing the current waveform and device characteristics from a real 500 kV HCB [5] is shown in Fig. 4, which is essentially the same as the preceding analytical conclusion.

In addition, a very important phenomenon in Fig. 4 is that the heat sink remains at the low temperature after one operation (the material and weight of the heat sink is set as it actually is). Due to the low heat generated by power devices during the breaking process, it is generally not possible to cause a significant change in the heat sink temperature, which means that the circuit breaker does not need to wait again for the long cooling process after the current breaking, and the power electronics can quickly return to its initial low temperature state within tens of milliseconds.

### _Discussion of Reliability_

Thermoelectric cooling modules are considered to be highly reliable components due to their solid-state construction. Especially under long-term stable operating conditions such as dc circuit breakers, the semiconductors can generally reach a life time of 200 000 h as they do not experience excessive thermal cycling, which far exceeds the engineering requirements for reliability [11]. On the other hand, even if a small probability event of failure occurs, since the large number of power electronic switching modules in the circuit breaker are connected in series, the adjacent cooling unit can also work as a redundancy for the failed unit.

## III Prototype Development and Experiment

As shown in Fig. 5(a), six pieces of thermoelectric cooler (TEC1-12706, piece price 10 RMB) are mounted on a press-pack IGBT based power electronic switch module, which adopts the structure in Fig. 2(b). The thermal simulation in Fig. 5(b) shows that even though the cooling units are only mounted on one side of the main heat sink, the temperature of the IGBT package area is basically uniform.

In order to verify the cooling effect inside the device, the IEGT (4.5 kV/3 kA ST3000GXH24A) used for the power electronic switch prototype was disassembled and put into a temperature probe. As shown in Fig. 5(c), with 10 w power for each cooler (30 w total, some low-speed fans are also mounted on the coolers to dissipate heat), the internal temperature of IEGT can eventually drop by about 15 \({}^{\circ}\)C after 4 h.

According to (4), after adding the cooling unit, this module is expected to increase the current capacity by 8%. It should be noted that the temperature drop created by this cooling system is fixed regardless of the ambient temperature. And the higher the ambient temperature, the smaller the device's original temperature rise range will be, and the performance benefit brought by the same temperature drop will be greater. Therefore, in the real converter valve hall (ambient temperature 50 \({}^{\circ}\)C) this method will have a more obvious effect.

The power electronic switch module is also tested with single pulse before and after cooling to compare the current performance. The experiments utilize the entire IEGT device package, and only one chip is reserved in the device in consideration of the experimental cost. The test waveform is the sawtooth waves with the same pulse width (2 ms). Although it is not identical to the waveform of the power electronic switch in the HCB, it is sufficient to demonstrate the cooling impact.

During the experimental test, the amplitude of the sawtooth wave current is gradually increased until the device is desaturated when the current reaches the peak value, which means that the device has reached the limit. The power electronic switch was tested before and after cooling, and the results are compared, as

shown in Fig. 6. It can be seen that the maximum current of the device is enhanced from 408-441 A after the device temperature is reduced from 29-13 \({}^{\circ}\)C via partial precooling.

## IV Cost-Effectiveness Analysis

Based on the actual prototype results and relevant engineering experience, the cost effectiveness of the proposed precooling method under different conditions is briefly analyzed and predicted. In fact, for the power electronic switching module in dc circuit breakers, the power electronic device IQBT undoubtedly take up the most cost, and the cost of the isolated power supply is also quite high, while the cost of the cooling unit is actually negligible. However, the additional power required for the cooling unit will cause a small increase in the cost of power supply. The related cost-benefit scenarios can be derived, as indicated in Table I, by taking into account all of these cost elements (the original available temperature rise range is 50-120 \({}^{\circ}\)C). As can be seen, with the adoption of precooling technology, the increased cost of 2% and 5% is predicted to result in a 10% and 19% performance improvement, respectively.

## V Conclusion

Starting from this unique aspect of temperature, this letter studies a novel performance enhancement method for power electronics in HCBs. The thermoelectric cooling technique can cost-effectively and reliably precool crucial portions of power electronic switch in HCBs, then considerably enhancing their transient surge performance. This method is compatible with other common performance enhancement methods for power electric devices (such as increasing gate voltage), and it is expected to increase the current capability of the device by more than 10% on the existing basis, while requiring negligible cost.
