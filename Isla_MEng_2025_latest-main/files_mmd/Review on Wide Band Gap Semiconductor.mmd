## I Introduction

The first research regarding Wide Band Gap materials were started in United States. In 1980s, group II-VI compounds were used as Wide Band Gap semiconductor and in 1990s _GaN_ found its application as WBG material [1]. After that different project were carried out by different project agencies of American and European countries. Some of these projects includes Advanced Defence Projects in US, ESCAPEE in Europe and NEDO from Japan [2].

## II Silicon vs Wide Band Gap Semiconductor

### _Limitations of Si semiconductor_

_Si_ is a mature technology which has been commonly used since 1950s in manufacturing of different power electronic devices. But _Si_ based power devices have some theoretical limitations. As the band gap of _Si_ is low, its intrinsic carrier concentration is high, and it results high leakage current particularly in high temperature [3]. Also, it is seen that the _Si_ can operate at relatively low frequency range (_less than 10KHz_). With the increase of switching frequency in _Si_ based devices the power loss is high and the no of passive components to design the device is increased, which in turn increases the size and weight of the device.

### _Advantages of Wide Band Gap Materials_

Due to several constraints _Si_ based materials are not enough to support the modern societal needs, though it is very much cost effective. The Wide Band Gap Ssemiconductor (WBGS) has many advantages for Optoelectronics and Power electronics applications, particularly in mm and sub mm wavelength region due to their large band-gap energy i.e. more than 2.2 eV.

The band gap difference for WBG is at least three times more than the _Si_ based semiconductor. Among different wide band gap materials diamond has the highest band gap difference. Also, the wide bandgap materials work very well in harsh environment, where _Si_ stops working, because the second-generation semiconductor materials such as Si, have different major limitations like high loss, low switching frequency, poor high temperature performance [4]. But the third-generation wide band gap power semiconductors, have some material properties to overcome these problems and they have some benefits, like high saturated drift velocity, high critical breakdown electric field, etc. So, these materials find applications in many emerging areas including military, food industry, and biomedical engineering

## III Characteristics of Wide Band Gap Materials

### _High Breakdown Voltage_

Wide Band Gap materials have larger electric field with high breakdown voltage. Breakdown voltage also depends on

Fig. 1: Energy band diagram for WBG semiconductordoping density. The breakdown voltage (\(V_{b}\)) of diode can be expressed in Ref. [5] as follows -

\[V_{b}=\frac{\varepsilon_{r}E_{c}^{2}}{2qN_{d}} \tag{1}\]

Where, \(q\) is the charge of an electron and \(N_{d}\) is the doping density.

To get high breakdown voltage the device is made thinner, by reducing the width of the device. The width of the drift region of a diode can be expressed as [6] -

\[W=\sqrt{2\frac{\varepsilon}{q}V_{0}(\frac{1}{N_{a}}+\frac{1}{N_{d}})} \tag{2}\]

The On resistance of the unipolar device can be explained by following equation -

\[R_{on}=\frac{4V_{b}^{2}}{\varepsilon E_{c}^{2}\mu_{n}} \tag{3}\]

Where,

\(R_{on}\) is the resistance of the device in the on-state multiplied by the device area

\(V_{b}\) is the avalanche breakdown voltage,

\(\varepsilon\) is permittivity of material

\(E_{c}\) is the electric breakdown field

\(\mu_{n}\) is the electron mobility

### _High Drift Velocity_

In High frequency, the switching speed of a diode is directly proportional to the drift velocity. Again, high drift velocity removes the charge carrier from depletion region, which decreases the reverse recovery current and consequently reduce the reverse recovery time. The drift velocity of wide band gap materials is very high (almost twice), compared to traditional _Si_ material. Accordingly switching speed of the wide band gap material-based diode improves, especially in higher frequency region.

### _High Thermal Conductivity_

Wide band gap semiconductor-based diode can operate in extreme temperature conditions. In table 1, the thermal conductivity of different WBG semiconductor is shown, which indicates that diamond has the best thermal conductivity, compared to Si or other WBG semiconductors.

## IV Characteristics Comparison of WBG Materials

The electrical characteristics of different wide band gap materials are compared with Si, and listed in the table 1.

If the performance of the wide band gap material-based devices is analysed, then from the table 1, it is evident that diamond shows the most promising characteristics over _Si_ or other WBG semiconductors in every aspect. But the cost and availability of the diamond makes it less popular, whereas _SiC_ and _GaN_ are rapidly used wide band gap materials for design of different semiconductor devices. Now a days _ZnO_ is also used and investigated for different applications [9].

Fig. 3: Breakdown voltage vs width of Depletion region

Fig. 2: Dopong concentration vs width of Depletion region Based on the review on studies carried out by different researchers the characteristics of different WBG semiconductor materials are summarized as -

### _Silicon Carbide (SiC)_

_SiC_ devices have achieved remarkable advancements, among different wide band gap materials, since 1987. Commercially it became popular from 1993 and _SiC_ based devices come in the market from 2001. From 2015, 200 mm wafers was demonstrated, and currently the wafer size is reduced to 150 mm. _SiC_ diodes are mostly Schottky diode. _SiC_ power switches such as _JFET_, _BJT_, _MOSFET_ are currently used, which shows higher switching performance, efficiency, and power density in the temperature range required by power electronic applications. These diodes also provide zero reverse recovery, low forward voltage, current stability and low on resistance. The breakdown voltage of _SiC_ switches ranges from 600-1700 V and current 1-60 A is currently available [10]. Despite of remarkable performance of _SiC_ is found in different application area, it has some constraints like reliability issues, module integration, and packaging issues particularly for developing commercial power devices. Summarizing, _SiC_ has the advantages like high efficiency, high thermal conductivity, high operating frequency, high reliability, component reduction etc. but the main challenges with _SiC_ technology includes high cost, packaging and availability of the materials [11].

### _Gallium Nitride (GaN)_

Although _GaN_ used since last millennia, but from 2010 numerous research has been carried out on _GaN_. Current research shows that due to high bandgap _GaN_ has exceptionally high breakdown voltage and electron mobility with low on resistance, which attracts a lot of focus on this wide band gap material. _GaN_ is mostly used in optoelectronics applications. Theoretically, _GaN_ has some superior electrical properties with respect to _SiC_. But due to some degraded material quality _GaN_ was not used much. Later on, the lateral structure on _GaN_ (like _AlGaN/GaN_) was invented, and shows better performance in high frequency low power applications, with respect to _Si_ or _SiC_ counterparts [12]. Though lateral or quasi vertical _GaN_-based diode shows reliable performance up to THz frequency (mm & sub mm wavelength) range, but some lattice mismatch and defects are associated with these devices [13]. Also, _GaN_ has some poor thermal conductivity compared to other WBG semiconductors.

### _Gallium Arsenide (GaAs)_

Due to wide band gap _GaAs_ can withstand much heat, and can operate with high temperature variation, then _Si_, even in high frequency region. Unlike different semiconductor materials _GaAs_ is a direct band gap semiconductor. That's why it can emit light with high efficiency and also prevent radiation damage [14]. Although _GaAs_ has high electron mobility, low noise, high efficiency but material is very costly and natural oxides are available like _Si_ (_SiO_). At the same time _GaAs_ wafers are very much brittle, and available in small size (about 4 inch). So, _GaAs_ mostly used in some special applications like different space electronics, power electronics, medical devices and solar cells [15].

### _Zinc Oxide (ZnO)_

Now a days enormous research has been carried out on Zinc oxide as it is wide band gap material and at the same time very much environment friendly. Semiconductor industries are greatly influenced by the dielectric properties of the material as it determines the charge storage capability of the material [16]. _ZnO_ is expected to be used as storage element in different electronic and opto-electronic applications. It is very much ideal for the design of different gas sensors, solar cells, ultra violet light emitter, surface acoustic wave devices, and lithium-ion batteries.

Compared to other group III nitrides _ZnO_ has some noticeable advantages. It can operate at much higher frequency and voltage. Also, _ZnO_ has a large e intervalley separation (around 3.23 eV), compared to other wide gap semiconductor, which may be used for no parabolic approximation for the conduction band around the centre of the Brillouin zone even at moderately high electric field up to several hundred kV/cm [17]. _ZnO_ can withstand large temperature variation.

### _Diamond_

As per the growing research on wide band gap semiconductor technology, furnished in table 1, Diamond shows the best theoretical performance among different wide band gap materials, in terms of high frequency, high power, high temperature applications, but the main limitation with this material is that, it requires high processing temperature as it is a very hard material.[18] At the same time, natural diamond has extremely variable properties, which limits the design of nanoscale layers and structures, for commercial applications. Till now not much research is carried out with diamond, but due to its extreme properties, it is expected to be used in switch, power devices and high frequency FETs with outstanding performance. The first high temperature power diode which is reported, is the diamond-based diode which can operate at 1000\({}^{\text{o}}\)C [19].

## V Figure of Merit

Apart from the characteristics mentioned above, there is another very important characteristics known as Figure Of Merit (FOM), which plays a crucial role towards selection of semiconductor materials for specific applications. Several studies have been carried out on FOM by different scientist and there are different types of for WBG Semiconductors: FOM stands for figure of merit, which is a numerical value, indicating the performance of a particular semiconductor material. Different FOM can be explained as follows [20][21] -

### _Jfom_

JFOM stands for Johnson's Figure of Merit, which is used to learn the frequency capability of a device. This particular figure of merit indicates how suitable is a semiconductor material for use in high frequency power transistor applications, specially in low-voltage transistors.

\[JFOM=\frac{E_{c}V_{\text{s}}}{2\pi} \tag{4}\]

Where, \(E_{c}\) is critical breakdown voltage, and \(\text{V}_{\text{s}}\) is the saturation drift velocity of electron.

### _Kfom_

KFOM stands for Keyes' Figure of Merit, which shows the thermal limitation of a device's switching behaviour. This is specially to be taken into account for the intended application of a device for high-speed switching. Lower KFOM indicates higher thermal constraints.

\[KFOM=\lambda\sqrt{\frac{cV_{\text{s}}}{4\pi\epsilon}} \tag{5}\]

Where, \(\lambda\) is the thermal conductivity, \(c\) the velocity of light and \(\epsilon\) the dielectric constant.

### _Bfom_

BFOM stands for Baliga's Figure of Merit (BFOM), which defines material parameters that would be able to minimize the conduction loss of a low-frequency unipolar device. This FOM is very useful in determining the technological limit of a semiconductor material. This also assumes that self-heating is non-existent. Further this FOM can be used to estimate a trade-off between various on-resistances.

\[BFOM=\epsilon\mu E_{B}^{3} \tag{6}\]

Where \(\mu\) is the carrier mobility and \(E_{g}\) is the bandgap of the semiconductor device.

### _Bhffom_

There is also an additional FOM used for high frequency devices known as Baliga's High Frequency Figure of Merit (Bhffrom)

\[BFOM=\mu E_{B}^{3}\sqrt{\frac{V_{G}}{4V_{B}^{3}}} \tag{7}\]

Where \(V_{G}\) is the gate-drive voltage and \(V_{B}\) is the gate bias voltage.

### _Hmfom_

Huang has introduced several Figures of Merit for material, temperature, chip area and device performance. HMFOM stands for Huang's Material Figure of Merit, which determines the suitability of a material for high frequency application.

\[HMFOM=E_{c}\sqrt{\mu} \tag{8}\]

### _Hcafom_

HCAFOM stands for Huang's Chip Area Figure of Merit, which allows the calculation of optimal chip area possible for deriving the best performance out of a given device for the concerned material. This is primarily useful to theoretically guess how much circuit level size reduction is possible without giving up efficiency.

\[HCAFOM=\epsilon\sqrt{\mu}E_{c}^{2} \tag{9}\]

### _Hifom_

HTFOM stands for Huang's Thermal Figure of Merit, which describes the maximum temperature withstand capability.

\[HTFOM=\frac{\lambda}{\epsilon E_{c}} \tag{10}\]

Huang's FOMs have received criticism for simplifying the switching behaviour by ignoring various factors such as power loss due to switching at gate. It instead uses the gate-do-drain Miller charge and on-resistance of the device.

On the other hand, according to Huang, the charge-discharge cycling of the gate-to-drain charge is the dominating factor for calculating switching loss in a high voltage device. And supposedly provides much improved estimation of the switching losses compared to Baliga's method of calculating FOM.

All these Figures of Merit have been programmatically recalculated and tabulated for a straight-forward comparison of WBG materials for the suitability of application in high-speed switching, high frequency devices.

## VI Different Applications of WBG

Replacement of Si technology, with WBG semiconductor provides a lot improvement in different applications, which allow devices to operate at much higher temperatures, voltages, and frequencies. So, WBG based power electronic devices become much more powerful and energy efficient [22].

### _Electronic Sensor_

Wide Band gap materials are the primary choice of the designers for designing optoelectronic sensors, since they provide low dark signal at room temperature, high radiation hardness, solar-blindness, and thermal stability electronic sensors, made with WBG semiconductor can tolerate extreme environmental conditions like high-pressure and high-temperature.

### _Aerospace_

One of the most emerging areas, where WBG semiconductor is widely used is Aerospace Industry. The expected design of the wings of the aeroplanes should be longer, thinner and lighter, for its robust operation at various temperature region. So, in the air transport industries WBG based devices have significant contributions [23].

### _Industrial Motors_

For designing different pumps, fans, compressors WBG materials can be used to achieve higher-efficiency.

### _Power Electronics_

In power delivery network, WBG devices are the main element for efficient system design, which can tolerate large temperature differences. On the other hand, the development of DC power lines can be improved using WBG based power electronics.

### _Transport_

For electric battery-based vehicles, use of WBG can reduced the electricity consumption by 66%. Also, this can tolerate higher temperature variations and reduce the size of automotive cooling system.

### _Renewable energy devices_

WBG based devices are also used in renewable energy devices like, solar system, wind power devices, at higher frequency range to reduce the cost and size of the devices.

### _Military_

In military WBG has wide applications, for designing high power devices. Also, it includes satellite communication and radar system [24].

## VII Limitations of WBG based semiconductors:

Despite lot of advantages of wide band gap semiconductor, some challenges are also associated with this technology [25].

### _Integration_

For large applications of WBG materials, integration of WBG devices is needed, so that it can be easily used as replacement of Si.

### _Cost_

In some cases, with the improvement of wafer quality, the production cost of larger-diameter wide band gap semiconductor wafers needs to be reduced, for enhancement of its huge applications.

### _Device Design_

To make WBG much more unique and commercial with respect to Si materials, the capability of this material must be improved by modifying system complexity, and integration. For effectively exploiting the properties of wide band gap materials in different application areas the device designs need to be modified. Some alternative packaging and design in WBG should be introduced which will be much more energy efficient and can tolerate more temperature variations.

## VIII.Conclusion

The direct comparison of the various Figures of Merit of the WBG materials at a single place, allows for an overall qualitative performance analysis of the use of the said materials in various day-to-day applications. While Silicon is still the preferred material for most semiconductor devices it lacks in areas, where other WBG materials are excellent at. The study of the FOMs here allows the researchers to pick and choose an optimal configuration that achieves the purpose of the device in concern. Also, FOMs are not the sole determining factor when choosing a material as seen in diamond, whose FOMs being superior still doesn't allow for optimal use due to physical properties and rarity of abundance. While Zinc Oxide establishes itself as a competitor to Silicon for many semiconductors device fabrication as it matches or exceeds Silicon's FOMs in many cases, while still being less efficient in terms of Chip miniaturization for nano-scale electronic devices.

Due to remarkable advancement of wide band gap semiconductor technology, now a days it becomes the foundation of different industries. But still some significant improvements in this field are to be done to utilize the full potential of these materials. Till the research is carried out on material properties, their processing, new design and cost effectiveness. So, in near future it is expected that Wide band gap semiconductor materials will open up some new potentials, especially in power electronics, IT, renewables and transportation, and the extensive use of WBG based devices will finally save billions of energy cost
