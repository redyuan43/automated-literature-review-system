###### Abstract

Quantum cascade lasers (QCLs)[1] are widely used sources of coherent radiation based on intersubband (ISB) transitions in quantum wells (QWs) with particularly good performance in the mid-IR spectral region. Due to their operation mechanism, QCLs would benefit from improved confinement in the upper lasing state by the introduction of 3D-confined quantum dots (QDs)[2] or quantum dashes (QDashes), which would also allow for transverse-electric polarized light unachievable in QW-based QCLs due to ISB selection rules. We demonstrate for the first time transverse-electric (TE) electroluminescence (EL) from an in-plane-confined state of InAs/AlInAs QDashes grown in a QC structure[3].

Differently from previous attempts at obtaining EL from QC structures based on InAs/GaAs QDs[4, 5], we concentrated our effort on InAs/AlInAs QDashes grown on InP[6]. In Fig. 1a, we show the measured TE-polarized ISB absorption from the ground state ([1,1,1->) to the first excited state ([2,1,1->) associated with the lateral confinement due to the width of the dashes (the [110] direction in the inset of Fig. 1a). The absorption peaked at 89 meV and the extrapolated dipole moment for this transition was 1.7 nm. The QDashes were then used as active elements in a QC structure designed to inject in the [2,1,1-> state of measured transition (inset Fig. 1b). This active region was repeated 50 times and then processed as wide ridge lasers. Fig. 1b shows the EL for two devices of size 30\(\times\)1500\(\mu\)m one with length along the dash elongation ([1-10] direction, thick blue line) and the other perpendicular to it (thin blue line). Both devices exhibited TM-polarized emission, however TE-polarized EL was present only for devices processed with ridges parallel to the dash elongation and was centered around 110 meV, in good agreement with the absorption measurements.

The TE EL signal, which was present also at room temperature, increased with applied bias but no sign of gain could be seen before a negative differential resistance occurred in the IV characteristic curve. We expect improvement in the design could provide the sought population inversion and we will present recent results showing the effect of changing the width of the extraction barrier in the active region.
