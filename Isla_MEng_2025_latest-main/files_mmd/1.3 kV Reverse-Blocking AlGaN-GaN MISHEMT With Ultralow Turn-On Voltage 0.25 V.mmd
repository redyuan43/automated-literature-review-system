to 0.25 V. A more than 1300 V bidirectional blocking voltage, the highest reverse figure-of-merit (FOM\({}_{\rm R}\)) of 509 MW/cm\({}^{2}\) and the highest forward figure-of-merit (FOMF) of 494 MW/cm\({}^{2}\) could be achieved in the fabricated devices. Besides, the good thermal stability could be observed in RB-MISHEMT. Simulations with Silcavo have been conducted to further reveal the operation mechanism in RB-MISHEMT.

## II Device Structure and Fabrication

A cross-sectional schematic of the proposed RB-MISHEMT is shown in Fig. 1(a). The device structure was grown on a 4-in semi-insulating SiC substrate by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition system (MOCVD). The epitaxial structure consists of a 2 nm undoped GaN cap layer, a 28 nm Al\({}_{0.21}\)Ga\({}_{0.79}\)N barrier layer, a 1 nm AlN spacer layer, and a 1.6 \(\upmu\)m undoped-GaN buffer layer. The Hall-effect measurement showed a sheet resistance of \(\sim 377\Omega/\square\), a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) density of \(7.9\times 10^{12}\) cm\({}^{-2}\), and an electron mobility of 2100 cm\({}^{2}\)/V-s.

The device fabrication started with 20 nm SiN passivation deposited by low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD). After removing the passivation layer in the source and drain area by RIE with CF4/Ar, the ohmic metal Ti/Al/Ni/Au (= 22/140/5/45 nm) was directly deposited by E-beam evaporation, followed by rapid thermal annealing (RTA) at 850\({}^{\circ}\)C for 30 s in N\({}_{2}\) ambient to form the ohmic contact. Then a mesa isolation was realized by RIE etching. After SiN opening at the drain recess region, a low damage RIE etching process with an etch rate of 1.8 nm/min was performed to form the drain recess. A residual AlGaN barrier thickness of 3 nm is confirmed by AFM measurement as shown in Fig. 1(b), and the surface RMS roughness of the etched area is 0.36 nm. Next, the exposed AlGaN barrier surface was cleaned by a diluted HCl solution (HCl:H\({}_{2}\)O = 1:20) followed by annealing at 450\({}^{\circ}\)C for 5 min in the N\({}_{2}\) ambient to recover the etch damage. Finally, the gate and drain Schottky metal W (200 nm) was simultaneously sputtered and patterned by lift-off, which was followed by an RTA process at 450\({}^{\circ}\)C for 5 min.

The conventional MISHEMT with ohmic drain (MISHEMT) has been also fabricated on the same wafer for reference. Unless otherwise specified, both devices have the same dimensions, in which gate-to-source distance (\(L_{\rm gg}\)), gate length (\(L_{\rm g}\)), gate-to-drain distance (\(L_{\rm gd}\)), were 3 \(\upmu\)m, 2 \(\upmu\)m and 16 \(\upmu\)m respectively. The \(L_{\rm gd}\) for RB-MISHEMT refers to the distance between the gate and the drain recess region, and the drain recess width (\(L_{\rm t}\)) and overlap extension (\(L_{\rm ov}\)) were 5 \(\upmu\)m and 1 \(\upmu\)m, respectively. The gate width was 100 \(\upmu\)m. Compared with the conventional HEMT, the proposed device features a recessed Schottky drain embedded into the ohmic drain electrode so as to lower \(V_{\rm on}\), blocking the reverse current flow to achieve reverse blocking.

## III Results and Discussion

Fig. 2 shows the transfer and output characteristics of both devices. Nearly the same transfer curves could be observed in both devices with threshold voltage of \(-6.5\) V, and maximum transconductance of 100 mS/mm and ON/OFF ratio of \(10^{7}\). A small differential on-resistance (\(r_{\rm on}\)) and maximum \(I_{\rm D}\) in RB-MISHEMT are 10.4 \(\Omega\)-mm and 650 mA/mm, which are very close to the results in the referenced MISHEMT (\(R_{\rm on}=9.8\)\(\Omega\)-mm, \(I_{\rm D}=650\) mA/mm). This demonstrates a slight influence of the recessed Schottky drain on the forward \(I-V\) curves of RB-MISHEMT, compared with the counterpart. An ultralow \(V_{\rm on}\) of 0.25 V (extracted at \(I_{\rm D}=1\) mA/mm), a forward voltage (\(V_{\rm F}\)) of 1.4 V (defined at 100 mA/mm), and an on-resistance of 14.6 \(\Omega\)-mm (\(R_{\rm on}\), calculated at \(I_{\rm D}=100\) mA/mm) are achieved in RB-MISHEMT. Here, the \(V_{\rm F}\) at higher current drives (100 mA/mm) is considered, which is used to evaluate the device performance in the real applications. The ultralow \(V_{\rm on}\) could be attributed to the obviously reduced Schottky barrier height realized by the partially recessed AlGaN barrier combined with a low work function W.

Log scale \(I_{\rm D}-V_{\rm DS}\) curves of RB-MISHEMT at \(V_{\rm GS}=0\) V are shown in Fig. 3(a), which presents rectification behavior for the hybrid Schottky-ohmic drain diode. And the extracted Schottky barrier height and ideality factor are 0.44 eV and 1.67, respectively. Fig. 3(b) shows the forward and reverse breakdown characteristics of RB-MISHEMT, and the forward breakdown characteristics of conventional MISHEMT. The forward breakdown voltage is 1272 V for conventional MISHEMT, while the forward breakdown voltage (\(BV_{\rm F}\)) and reverse breakdown voltage (\(BV_{\rm R}\)) are 1315 V and \(-1332\) V at 10 \(\upmu\)A/mm for RB-MISHEMT, respectively,

which demonstrates great bidirectional blocking performance of RB-MISHEMT. The embedded hybrid Schottky-ohmic drain has little effect on the \(BV_{F}\) of RB-MISHEMT and achieves a high \(BV_{R}\).

It is necessary to investigate the device behavior at high temperature because the actual temperature of GaN power devices could exceed 100\({}^{\circ}\)C during circuit operation [4]. The forward and reverse \(I_{\rm D}-V_{\rm DS}\) characteristics of RB-MISHEMT depended on the temperature are plotted in Fig. 4. The \(V_{\rm on}\) decreases from 0.25 V to 0.19 V and the \(R_{\rm on}\) increases from 10.4 \(\Omega\)-mm to 19.4 \(\Omega\)-mm, with the temperature increasing from 25\({}^{\circ}\)C to 125\({}^{\circ}\)C. The increase of reverse leakage current at high temperature is due to the lower Schottky barrier and stronger thermionic emission at a reverse biased Schottky junction.

\(I_{\rm D}-V_{\rm DS}\) curves for 80 devices are plotted in Fig. 5(a), demonstrating a high uniformity of the recessed hybrid Schottky-ohmic drain. Fig. 5(b) shows the distribution of the \(V_{\rm on}\) for 80 devices extracted from Fig. 5(a) using 1 mA/mm as the criteria. The mean value of \(V_{\rm on}\) is 0.252 V with a small standard derivation of 0.01 V.

The comparison of the proposed RB-MISHEMT with reported reverse blocking GaN devices is carried out in Table 1. Considering a 1.5 \(\upmu\)m transfer length for each ohmic contact, the specific \(R_{\rm on}\) (\(R_{\rm on,sp}\)) for RB-MISHEMT is 3.5 m\(\Omega\)-cm\({}^{2}\). By using the hybrid Schottky-ohmic drain and low work function W, the proposed RB-MISHEMT exhibits the lowest \(V_{\rm on}\) of 0.25 V, the lowest \(V_{\rm F}\) of 1.4 V, the highest \(\rm FOM_{\rm R}\) of 509 MW/cm\({}^{2}\), and the highest \(\rm FOM_{\rm F}\) of 494 MW/cm\({}^{2}\). And the trade-off between \(BV\) and \(R_{\rm on,sp}\) is shown in Fig. 6. A good trade-off between \(BV\) and \(R_{\rm on,sp}\) is achieved of the fabricated RB-MISHEMT among the reported reverse blocking devices. In addition, there is a trade-off between the \(V_{\rm on}\) and the reverse leakage current, which is attributed to a lower \(V_{\rm on}\) (namely representing a lower barrier height) leading to a large reverse leakage current. Fig. 7 shows the \(V_{\rm on}\) versus reverse leakage current benchmark of RB-MISHEMT against the reported GaN low \(V_{\rm on}\) rectifiers. As shown, the RB-MISHEMT also shows a relatively good trade-off between \(V_{\rm on}\) and reverse leakage current among the reported counterparts.

In order to further investigate the operation mechanism of RB-MISHEMT, the proposed device is simulated by Silvaco ATLAS. The RB-MISHEMT operation mechanism is illustrated in Fig. 8(a)-(d). As shown in Fig. 8(a), the Schottky metal of hybrid drain in the recess region is used to completely deplete the 2DEG under the recessed AlGaN at \(V_{\text{D}}=0\) V. The depletion function is similar to the gate depletion in the recessed normally-off GaN HEMT. When the drain electrode is biased at negative voltage \(V_{\text{D}}=-100\) V in Fig. 8(b), the depletion region near the drain will be further expanded by the reverse biased Schottky junction. The overlap extension (\(L_{\text{ov}}\)) could work as a field plate (FP) to relieve the high electric field near recessed Schottky junction. On the other hand, when the drain bias is increased from 0 V to a small positive voltage 0.2 V in Fig. 8(c), the channel under the recessed Schottky will not be depleted, and a small drain current begins to flow from ohmic drain to the source. With the increase of drain voltage, the hybrid Schottky drain is turned on, and the drain current is composed of Schottky drain current and ohmic drain current [22], leading to ultralow turn-on voltage of 0.25 V. When a relatively large voltage 3 V is applied to the drain electrode in Fig. 8(d), the conduction current is very large and comparable to conventional MISHEMT. The depth of recess drain is very important for the ultralow \(V_{\text{on}}\) of RB-MISHEMT. And there is a trade-off between \(V_{\text{on}}\) and the reverse leakage current. If the residual AlGaN barrier is too thick, the 2DEG under the recess will not be depleted by the Schottky drain, which is similar to the ohmic drain and thus leads to a serious reverse leakage current. When the recess depth is larger than the thickness of AlGaN barrier, the ohmic drain will play no role in the forward current conduction.

The thermal stability and long-term reliability of this device have been considered. Thermal storage tests are carried out at 200\({}^{\circ}\)C for different time to evaluate the influence of Schottky-ohmic drain stability on the device performance. As shown in Fig. 9. the forward and reverse \(I_{\text{D}}-V_{\text{DS}}\) characteristics of Schottky-ohmic drain before and after thermal storage testing at 200\({}^{\circ}\)C are compared. An increase in Schottky barrier height and a decrease in ideality factor after thermal storage at 200\({}^{\circ}\)C for 24 hours could be observed. In addition, the reverse leakage current is reduced as the increase in time. These results are attributed to the reduction of interfacial layer at the W Schottky interface after thermal storage, leading to a more ideal diode with a higher Schottky barrier height. Besides, the rearrangement of the

interface material structure might prevent the excess leakage current [25, 26]. These demonstrate the good thermal stability of RB-MISHEMT.

## 4 Conclusion

In this work, we have experimentally demonstrated the high-performance RB-MISHEMT based on hybrid Schottky-ohmic drain and low work function W techniques. The proposed device exhibits an ultralow \(V_{\text{on}}\) of 0.25 V, a high forward \(BV_{\text{F}}\) of 1315 V and a reverse \(BV_{\text{R}}\) of \(-1332\) V. Compared with current reported reverse blocking GaN HEMTs, a better trade-off between \(BV\) and \(R_{\text{on,sp}}\) has been achieved. Besides, the good thermal stability could be observed in RB-MISHEMT. Simulations are performed for the clear explanation of the operation mechanism of RB-MISHEMT. These results demonstrate the excellent performance of reverse blocking devices.
