###### Abstract

**Solar cells consisting of quantum dots of the same size have been worked on till date. Our work focuses on varying the size and increasing the Incident Photon to Current Conversion Efficiency of the intrinsic layer of a Silicon solar cell. We have been able to increase the IPCE up to 70% and 140% by widely varying the sizes of Cadmium Selenite and Cadmium Telluride quantum dots respectively. Their total volume fractions were kept constant.**

## I Introduction

Researches on solar cells having the same sized quantum dots have been going on for quite some time now. The effect of variation in the size of the quantum dots within the solar cell was considered in various research works and have been used as reference for our work with the aim of improving their power conversion efficiencies. Our work focuses on the improvement of incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the intrinsic layer of the solar cells, which leads to increase in overall conversion efficiency. For our work, we have used wide range of size variation in quantum dots keeping the total volume fraction constant. This showed a remarkable increase in the overall quantum efficiency. Numerous simulations were carried out using the "optical absorption model" method and were simulated using MATLAB simulation software. Comparison of the results with the published experimental research indicated a significant improvement. Simulations performed with multi-sized quantum dots doped inside Silicon (Si) substrates showed a potential improvement in IPCE.

## II Quantum efficiency

Quantum efficiency refers to the percentage of photons that are converted to electric current (i.e., collected carriers) when the cell is operated under short circuit conditions. The ratio of the number of charge carriers collected by the solar cell to the number of photons of a given energy shining on the solar cell from outside (incident photons) is called the External Quantum Efficiency (EQE) or Incident Photon to Current Conversion Efficiency (IPCE). Quantum efficiency alone is not the same as overall energy conversion efficiency, as it does not convey information about the fraction of power that is converted by the solar cell.

## III Reducing Loss in efficiency

There are two fundamental ways to utilize the hot carriers for enhancing the efficiency of photon conversion. One way produces an enhanced photovoltage, and the other way produces an enhanced photocurrent. The former requires that the carriers be extracted from the photocon converter before they cool while the latter requires the energetic hot carriers to produce a second (or more) electron-hole pair through impact ionization--a process that is the inverse of an Auger process whereby two electron-hole pairs recombine to produce a single highly-energetic electron-hole pair. In order to achieve the former, the rates of photogenerated carrier separation, transport, and interfacial transfer across the contacts to the semiconductor must all be fast compared to the rate of carrier cooling. The latter requires that the rate of impact ionization (i.e. inverse Auger effect) be greater than the rate of carrier cooling and other relaxation processes for hot carriers [1]. The process of impact ionization is shown in Fig. 1.

### _Impact Ionization_

Fig. 1: Multiple electron-hole pair (exciton) generation in quantum dotsTwo partial processes can be distinguished:

_1) Electron Emission:_ A highly energetic electron from the conduction band transfers its energy to an electron in the valence band. The valence electron moves to the conduction band generating an electron hole pair.

_2) Hole Emission:_ A highly energetic hole from the valence band transfers its energy to an electron in the valence band which is then excited to the conduction band generating an electron hole pair [2].

### _Use of Quantum Dot_

Finally, in recent years it has been proposed and experimentally verified in some cases, that the relaxation dynamics of photogenerated carriers may be markedly affected by quantization effects in the semiconductor (i.e., in semiconductor quantum wells, quantum wires, QDs, superlattices, and nanostructures). That is, when the carriers in the semiconductor are confined by potential barriers to regions of space that are smaller than or comparable to their deBroglie wavelength or to the Bohr radius of excitons in the semiconductor bulk, the relaxation dynamics can be dramatically altered; specially the hot carrier cooling rates may be dramatically reduced, and the rate of impact ionization could become competitive with the rate of carrier cooling.

For QDs, one mechanism for breaking the phonon bottleneck that is predicted to slow carrier cooling in QDs and hence allow fast cooling is an Auger process. Here a hot electron can give its excess kinetic energy to a thermalized hole via an Auger process, and then the hole can then cool quickly because of its higher effective mass and more closely spaced quantized states. However, if the hole is removed from the QD core by a fast hole trap at the surface, then the Auger process is blocked and the phonon bottleneck effect can occur, thus leading to slow electron cooling [1].

The most common approach to the synthesis of colloidal ionic QDs is the controlled nucleation and growth of particles in a solution of chemical precursors containing the metal and the anion sources. Sizes of the QDs can be varied in this process through size selective precipitation [3]. Quantum dots have a high control over its conductivity varying its size. As the size gets smaller, the exitonic Bohr radius becomes smaller, therefore needs huge energy to break it. Consequently, bandgap becomes higher. Smaller-sized quantum dots show greater charge injection rates into the substrate and also higher IPCE at the excitonic band. Larger particles have better absorption in the visible region but cannot inject electrons into substrate as effectively as smaller-sized quantum dots [4].

## IV Model

Various sizes of quantum dots were doped inside the intrinsic layer of the Silicon (Si) solar sell. We assumed the QDs to be spherical and varied their diameter in order to vary their sizes. Keeping the total volume fraction constant, we used five different sizes of Cadmium Selenite (CdSe) and Cadmium Telluride (CdTe) QDs which showed a significant change in the external quantum efficiency or IPCE compared to the reference work [5] where three and two different sizes of CdSe and CdTe QDs where used. Fig. 2 shows an approximate model pf the solar cell.

### _Cadmium Selenite (CdSe) Quantum Dot_

Cadmium selenite (CdSe) is a solid, binary compound of cadmium and selenium. Much current research on cadmium selenide has focused on nanoparticles. Researchers are concentrating on developing controlled syntheses of CdSe nanoparticles. In addition to synthesis, scientists are working to understand the properties of cadmium selenide, as well as apply these materials in useful ways. One of the most common QD materials are cadmium and selenium, forming CdSe wurzitenancorystals.

### _Cadmium Telluride (CdTe) Quantum Dot_

Cadmium Telluride (CdTe) is a crystalline compound formed from cadmium and tellurium. It is used as an infrared optical window and a solar cell material. It is usually sandwiched with cadmium sulfide to form a p-n junction photovoltaic solar cell. Typically, CdTe cells use a n-i-p structure. It has such optical and electronic properties that when the size of CdTe crystal is being reduced to a few nanometers and below, thus making a CdTe quantum dot, the fluorescence peak shifts towards through the visible range to the ultraviolet [6].

### _Silicon Substrate_

Silicon is the most commonly used semiconductor material in solar cell. It is an indirect semiconductor and has a bandgap 1.11 eV. Therefore we used equation 10 to calculate the absorption coefficient of Si substrate. The constant was obtained at room temperature.

## II Simulation Result

We used MATLAB simulating software for simulating the optical absorption model. The results are shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4.

Table I shows the comparison between the reference IPCE and the ones we obtained.

## III Conclusion

The efficiencies obtained from the optical absorption model indicate that there is a definite scope for improvement by using wide range of multi-sized QDs. Although there is no limit to variation in size utilization, but the limitation still remains in the cost efficiency of the overall device. Thus there lies a further scope of research in optimizing the system with equilibrium in both cost and variation in size. As always, the recombination losses in a real device will ultimately determine the utility of the simulated efficiency values. Lattice match must also be considered before experimental values of efficiency of any of the QDs doping in this work could be obtained. Other geometrical aspects of quantum dots such as shape and aspect ratio could also be studied as a factor to predict QD solar cell efficiencies. Future studies could utilize this model to determine the approximate efficiency and further the design approach based on this estimation.
